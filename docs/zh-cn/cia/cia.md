1. You tasked me to provide an assessment of the Gateway Experience in terms of its mechanics and ultimate practicality. As I set out to fulfill that tasking it soon became clear that in order to assess the validity and practicality of the process I needed to do enough supporting research and analysis to fully understand how and why the process works. Frankly, sir, that proved to be an extremely involved and difficult business. Initially, based on conversations witha physician who took the Gateway training with me, I had recourse to the biomedical models developed by Itzhak Bentov to obtain information concerning the physical aspects of the process. Then I found it necessary to delve into various sources for information concerning quantum mechanics in order to be able to describe the nature and functioning of human consciousness. I had to be able to construct a scientifically valid and reasonably lucid model of how consciousness functions under the influence of the brain hemisphere synchronization technique employed by Gateway. Once this was done, the next step involved recourse to theoretical physics in order to explain the character of the time-space dimension and the means by which expanded human consciousness transcends it in achieving Gateway's objectives. Finally, I again found it necessary to use physics to bring the whole phenomenon of out-of-body states into the language of physical science to remove the stigma of its occult connotations, and put it in a frame of reference suited to objective assessment.

1 您委托我对“Gateway体验”的机制及其实用性进行评估。在开始着手完成这一任务时，我很快意识到，为了评估该过程的有效性和实用性，我需要进行足够的支持性研究和分析，以充分理解该过程的运作原理和原因。坦率地说，先生，这证明是一项极其复杂且困难的工作。最初，基于与一位与我一起接受“Gateway”培训的医生的对话，我参考了伊扎克·本托夫（Itzhak Bentov）开发的生物医学模型，以获取关于该过程物理方面的信息。随后，我发现有必要深入研究各种来源的量子力学信息，以便能够描述人类意识的本质和功能。我必须能够构建一个科学上有效且合理清晰的模型，以解释在“Gateway”使用的大脑半球同步技术影响下，意识是如何运作的。在完成这一步后，下一步是求助于理论物理学，以解释时空维度的特性以及扩展的人类意识在实现“Gateway”目标时如何超越这一维度。最后，我再次发现有必要利用物理学将“体外状态”现象用物理科学的语言描述出来，以消除其神秘色彩，并将其置于适合客观评估的参考框架中。

2. I began the narrative by briefly profiling the fundamental biomedical factors affecting such related techniques as hypnosis, biofeedback and transcendental meditation so that their objectives and mode of functioning could be compared in the reader's mind with the Gateway experience as the model of its underlying mechanics was developed. Additionally, that introductory material is useful in supporting the conclusions of the paper. I indicate that at times these related techniques may provide useful entry points to accelerate movement into the Gateway Experience.

	2.	我首先简要介绍了影响催眠、生物反馈和超觉冥想等相关技术的基本生物医学因素，以便读者在脑海中将这些技术的目标和运作方式与“Gateway体验”进行比较，从而构建其基本机制的模型。此外，这些介绍性内容也有助于支持本文的结论。我指出，有时这些相关技术可能提供有用的切入点，以加速进入“Gateway体验”的过程。

3. Niels Bohr, the renowned physicist once responded to his son's complaints about the obtuse nature of certain concepts in physics by saying: "You are not thinking, you are merely being logical." The physics of altered human consciousness deals with some conceptualizations that are not easily grasped or visualized exclusively in the context of ordinary "left brain" linear thinking. So, to borrow Dr. Bohr's mode of expression, parts of this paper will require not only logic but a touch of right brain intuitive insight to achieve a complete comfortable grasp of the concepts involved. Nevertheless, once that is done, I am confident that their construction and application will stand up to the test of rational critique.

	3.	著名物理学家尼尔斯·玻尔曾回应他儿子对物理学中某些晦涩概念的抱怨时说：“你没有在思考，你只是逻辑化。”关于人类意识改变的物理学涉及一些概念，这些概念仅依靠普通的“左脑”线性思维并不容易理解或想象。因此，借用玻尔博士的表达方式，本文的部分内容不仅需要逻辑，还需要一些右脑的直觉洞察，才能完全舒适地掌握其中涉及的概念。尽管如此，一旦掌握了这些概念的构建和应用，我相信它们能够经受住理性批判的考验。

4. Paradoxically, having gone to such great lengths to avoid trying to render judgements based on an occult or dogmatic frame of reference in the end I found it necessary to return, at least briefly, to the question of the impact of theGateway Experience on common belief systems. I did so because although it was essential to avoid attempting to render an assessment i n the context of such systems, I felt that it was necessary after having completed the analysis to point out that the resulting conclusions do not do any violence to the fundamental mainstream of either eastern or western belief systems. Unless that point is clearly established, the danger exists that some people will reject the whole concept of the Gateway Experience in the mistaken belief that it contradicts and is therefore alien to all that they hold to be right and true.

	4.	矛盾的是，尽管我花了很大精力避免基于神秘或教条的参考框架来做出判断，最终我还是发现有必要至少简要地回到“Gateway体验”对常见信仰体系的影响这一问题上。我之所以这样做，是因为尽管在评估过程中有必要避免以这些信仰体系的背景进行分析，但在完成分析后，我觉得有必要指出，所得出的结论并未违反东西方主流信仰体系的基本核心。如果这一点没有明确确立，有些人可能会误以为“Gateway体验”与他们所坚持的信念相矛盾，进而完全拒绝这一概念。

5. This study is certainly not designed to be the last word on the subject but I hope that the validity of its basic structure and of the fundamental concepts upon which it is based will make it a useful guide for other USAINSCOM personnel who are required to take the Gateway training or work with Gateway materials.

	5.	本研究当然不是关于该主题的最终结论，但我希望其基本结构的有效性以及所依据的基本概念能够为其他需要接受“Gateway”培训或使用“Gateway”材料的美国陆军情报与安全司令部人员提供有用的指导。

## The Gateway Experience: Brain Hemisphere Synchronization in perspective.

### 1. Introduction.

In order to describe the Monroe Institute technique for achieving altered states of consciousness (the "Gateway Experience") involving brain hemisphere synchronization or "Hemi-Sync", the most effective way to begin is to briefly profile the basic mechanics which underlay operation of related methods such as hypnosis, transcendental meditation, and biofeedback. It is easiest to effectively describe what Gateway is by beginning with a short description of those associated techniques that share some common aspects with the Gateway Experience but which are nevertheless different. In this way we can develop a frame of reference at the outset which will provide useful concepts to explain and understand Gateway by comparison, as we proceed.

“Gateway体验”：脑半球同步的视角

	1.	引言
为了描述门罗研究所实现改变意识状态（即“Gateway体验”）的技术，该技术涉及脑半球同步或称“半球同步”（Hemi-Sync），最有效的方式是简要介绍支撑催眠、超觉冥想和生物反馈等相关方法运作的基本机制。通过从那些与“Gateway体验”有一些共同特征但又有所不同的相关技术的简短描述开始，可以更有效地描述“Gateway”是什么。通过这种方式，我们可以在一开始建立一个参考框架，提供有用的概念，通过比较来解释和理解“Gateway”，并在此过程中逐步深入。

### 2. Hypnosis.

According to the theories of psychologist Ronald Stone and the biomedicalengineering models of Itshak Bentov, hypnosis is basically a technique which permits acquisition of direct access to the sensory motor cortex and pleasure centers, and lower cerebral(emotional) portions(and associated pleasure centers) of the right side of the human brain following successful disengagement of the stimulus screening function of the left hemisphere of the brain.
The left hemisphere of the brain is the self-cognitive, verbal and linear reasoning component of the mina. It fulfills the function of screening incoming stimuli by categorizing, assessing and assigning meaning prior to allowing passage to the right hemisphere of the mind. The right hemisphere, which functions as the noncritical, holistic, nonverbal and pattern-oriented component of the brain appears to accept what the left hemisphere passes to it without question. Consequently, if the left hemisphere can be distracted either through boredom or through reduction to a soporific, semi-sleep state, external stimuli to include hypnotic suggestions are allowed to pass unchallenged into the right hemisphere where they are accepted and acted upon directly.
The result may involve an emotional reaction originating in the lower cerebral region, sensory/motor responses requiring involvement of the cortex, and so on. Both the sensory and the motor cortices of the right cerebral portion of the brain contain a sequence of points known as the "homunculus" which corresponds to points in the body(see Exhibit 1, next page). Stimulation of the corresponding area on the cortex causes intermediate response in the associated portion of the body. Consequently, induction of the suggestion that the left leg is numb, if it reaches the right hemisphere unchallenged and is referred to the appropriate area of the sensory cortex, will result in an electrical reaction being generated that will induce the feeling of numbness. Similarly, the suggestion that the person is experiencing a general feeling of happiness andwell being would be referred to the appropriate pleasure centers located in the lower cerebral portion or in the cortex of the right hemisphere, thereby inducing the suggested feeling of euphoria. F i n a l l y , suggestions such as one that informs the hypnotic subject that he enjoys enhanced concentration or powers of memory would be responded to in the right hemisphere by accessing unused information storage capacity normally held in reserve as a result of left hemisphere selection and control processes. This aspect will become significant in the context of the Gateway process when attention is given to examining the way that hypnosis may be used to accelerate progress in the early stages of the Gateway Experience.

	2.	催眠
根据心理学家罗纳德·斯通的理论和伊扎克·本托夫的生物医学工程模型，催眠基本上是一种技术，允许在成功解除左脑半球的刺激筛选功能后，直接进入大脑右侧的感觉运动皮层、愉悦中心和低层次的大脑（情感）区域及其相关的愉悦中心。大脑的左半球是自我认知、语言和线性推理的组成部分，负责通过分类、评估和赋予意义来筛选传入的刺激，在允许其进入大脑右半球之前进行处理。右半球作为非批判性、整体性、非语言和以模式为导向的大脑部分，似乎无条件地接受左半球传递给它的信息。因此，如果左半球被分散注意力，比如通过无聊或被诱导至一种昏昏欲睡的半睡状态，那么包括催眠暗示在内的外部刺激将可以不受质疑地进入右半球，在那里直接被接受并付诸行动。

结果可能涉及情绪反应，源自低层次的大脑区域，以及需要皮层参与的感觉/运动反应等。大脑右半球的感觉和运动皮层包含一个称为“微小人”的序列，这些点对应于身体的各个部位（见下页图1）。刺激皮层上的相应区域会在身体的相关部位产生即时反应。因此，如果不受质疑的麻木暗示到达右半球并被传递至感觉皮层的适当区域，将产生电反应，导致麻木的感觉。同样，关于愉悦和幸福的暗示会传递至右半球的低层次大脑区域或皮层中的适当愉悦中心，从而引发建议的欣快感。

最后，诸如提高集中力或记忆力的暗示会在右半球作出响应，访问通常因左半球的选择和控制过程而保留的未使用信息存储空间。在研究如何使用催眠加速“Gateway体验”早期阶段的进展时，这一方面将变得尤为重要。

### 3. Transcendental Meditation.

on the other hand, transcendental meditation works in adistinctlydifferent fashion. In this technique, intense and protractea single minded concentration on the process of drawing energy up the spinal cord ultimately results in what appears to be creation of acoustical standing waves in the cerebral ventricles which are then conducted to the gray matter in the cerebral

cortex on the right side of the brain. As a result, according to Bentov, these waves "will stimulate and eventually 'polarize' the cortex in such a way that i t will tend to conduct a signal along the homunculus, starting from the toes and on up." The Bentov bio-medical model, as described in a book by Lee Sannella, M.D., entitled:
Kundalini-Psychosis o rTranscendence, states that the standing acoustical waves are the result of thealteredrhythm of heart sounds which are occasioned by prolonged practice of meditation, and which set up sympathetic vibrations in the walls of the fluid filled cavities which comprise the third and lateral ventricles of the brain. In addition, according to Bentov: "The states of b l i s s described by those whose Kundalini symptoms have completed the full loop along the hemispheres may be explained as a self-stimulation of the pleasure centers in the brain caused by the circulation of a 'current' along the sensory cortex."
Bentov also notes,
"that most of the described symptoms start on the left side of the body means that it is mostly a development occurring in the right hemisphere." Although normally a period of meditation involving intense concentration and practice for five years or some is required to "bring up the Kundalini," Bentov states that exposure to mechanical or acoustical vibrations in the r a n g e of 4-7 Hertz(cycles per second) for protracted periods may achieve the same effect.
Bentov cites as an example "repeated riding in a car whose suspension and seat combination produce that range of vibrations, or being exposed for long periods of time to these frequencies caused, for instance, by an air conditioning duct." He also notes that:
"The cumulative effect of these vibrations may be able to trigger a spontaneous physio-Kundalini sequence in susceptable people who have a particularly sensitive nervous system."

	3.	超觉冥想
另一方面，超觉冥想的运作方式截然不同。在这种技术中，对将能量引导至脊髓上升的过程进行高度且持久的专注，最终似乎会在大脑的脑室中产生声学驻波，这些驻波随后传导至右脑皮层的灰质。因此，根据本托夫的说法，这些波“会以一种方式刺激并最终‘极化’皮层，使其倾向于沿着微小人（homunculus）传导信号，从脚趾开始向上。”如李·桑内拉（Lee Sannella）医生在其著作《昆达里尼：精神病还是超越》中所描述的那样，本托夫的生物医学模型指出，这些声学驻波是由于长时间冥想所导致的心音节律改变的结果，这些心音节律改变在充满液体的脑室（包括第三脑室和侧脑室）的壁上引发共振。

此外，根据本托夫的说法：“那些昆达里尼症状完成在大脑半球间循环的人所描述的至福状态，可以解释为由于在感觉皮层沿着‘电流’的循环而引发的大脑愉悦中心的自我刺激。”本托夫还指出，“大多数描述的症状从身体的左侧开始，这意味着大多是在右脑半球中发生的发展。”尽管通常需要大约五年时间的高度集中和冥想练习才能“激发昆达里尼”，本托夫表示，长时间暴露于4-7赫兹（每秒周期）的机械或声学振动也可能达到同样的效果。

本托夫举例说，“反复乘坐悬挂和座椅组合产生这种频率振动的汽车，或长时间暴露于例如由空调管道引起的这些频率”，也会产生类似的效果。他还指出：“这些振动的累积效应可能会在那些神经系统特别敏感的人身上引发自发的生理昆达里尼序列。”

### 4. Biofeedback.

The third consciousness altering methodology which will be briefly described is biofeedback.
Biofeedback is somewhat unique in that it actually employs the self-cognitive powers of the left hemisphere to gain access to such areas of the right brain as the lower cerebral, motor and sensory cortices and assorted pain or pleasure centers. Instead of suppressing the left hemisphere as is done in hypnosis, or largely bypassing and ignoring it as is done in transcendental meditation, biofeedback teaches the left hemisphere first to visualize the desired result and then to recognize the feelings associated with the experience of successful right hemisphere access to the specific lower cerebral, cortex, pain or pleasure or other areas in the manner needed to produce the desired result. Special self-monitoring devices such as the digital thermometer are used to inform the left brain when i t succeeds in keying the right hemisphere into accessing the appropriate area. Once this is done, the left brain can then repeatedly instruct the right brain to reestablish the pathways involved so as to produce the same external, objective measures of success.
In this way, the pathways are strengthened and emphasized to such an extent that left brain consciousness is enabled to access appropriate areas in the right brain using a conscious, demand mode.
For example, if the subject wishes to increase the circulation in the left leg in order to speed up healing he may concentrate with his left brain on achieving that result while carefully monitoring a digital thermometer connected to the left leg. When the concentrated effort begins to achieve success, the digital thermometer will register an increase in the temperature of the left leg.
At that point, the subject can mentally (left brain) associate the sensations experienced with the result achieved and can begin to emphasize, by memory recall, the same process to cause its strengthening by affirmation and repetition.
In this way, pain can be blocked, healing can be enhanced, malignant tumors can apparently be suppressed and ultimately destroyed, the body's pleasure centers can be stimulated, and a variety of specific physiological results may be achieved. In addition, biofeedback may be used to greatly accelerate achievement of deep meditative states particularly for beginners who have no experience in meditative techiques and whose progress in that methodology is enhanced through effective visualization and external, objective affirmation. Display of the subject's brainwave pattern on a cathode ray tube has proven to be a laboratory-validated means by which subjects may quickly learn to place themselves in profoundly relaxed states characterized by the sort of quietude and singularity of mental focus associated with advanced meditation.

	4.	生物反馈
第三种改变意识的技术是生物反馈。生物反馈有些独特之处，因为它实际上利用左半球的自我认知能力，来进入右脑的低层次大脑、运动和感觉皮层以及各种痛苦或愉悦中心。与催眠中抑制左半球，或在超觉冥想中绕过并忽视左半球不同，生物反馈先教导左半球将期望的结果进行可视化，然后让它识别出成功访问右脑特定低层次大脑、皮层、痛苦或愉悦等区域所带来的体验相关感觉。特定的自我监控设备，如数字温度计，用来告知左脑当它成功触发右脑访问相应区域时的状态。一旦完成此操作，左脑就可以反复指示右脑重新建立相应路径，以产生相同的外部客观成功指标。

通过这种方式，这些路径得到加强和强化，以至于左脑意识能够使用一种有意识的、需求导向的模式访问右脑的相应区域。例如，如果实验对象希望增加左腿的血液循环以加速愈合，他可以用左脑专注于实现这一结果，同时仔细监测连接到左腿的数字温度计。当专注的努力开始见效时，数字温度计会显示左腿温度上升。在此时，实验对象可以通过左脑将所体验到的感觉与实现的结果关联起来，并通过记忆回想、肯定和重复这一过程，以加强该路径的建立。

通过这种方式，疼痛可以被屏蔽，愈合可以被加速，恶性肿瘤可以被抑制甚至最终消除，身体的愉悦中心可以被激活，从而实现一系列特定的生理效果。此外，生物反馈还可以显著加快深度冥想状态的达成，特别适合没有冥想经验的初学者，通过有效的可视化和外部客观确认来提高其在该方法中的进展。通过在阴极射线管上显示实验对象的脑电波模式已被证明是一种实验室验证的方法，可以使实验对象快速学会进入深度放松的状态，这种状态具有与高级冥想相关的安静和专注。

### 5. Gateway and Hemi-Sync.

Now that we have briefly profiled the basic mechanics of the principal techniques for altering or expanding consciousness which share some of the objectives and/or methods employed in the Gateway Experience, we may proceed to focus on what that technique actually involves. Fundamentally, the Gateway Experience is a training system designed to bring enhanced strength, focus and coherence to the amplitude and frequency of brainwave output between the left and right hemispheres so as to alter consciousness, moving it outside the physical sphere so as to ultimately escape even the restrictions of time and space.
The participant then gains access to the various levels of intuitive knowledge which the universe offers. What differentiates the Gateway Experience from forms of meditation i s its use of the Hemi-Sync technique which is defined in a monograph by Monroe Institute trainer Melissa Jager as, "a state of consciousness defined when the EEG patterns of both hemispheres are simultaneously equal in amplitude and frequency." Although Hemi-Sync seems to be rather rare and of only short duration in ordinary human consciousness, Melissa Jager states that:
"Audio techniques developed by Bob Monroe can induce and sustain Hemi-Sync with
the Institute's basic Focus 3 tapes,..." She also notes that:
"Studies conducted by Elmer and Alyce Greene at the Menninger Foundation have shown that a subject with 20 years of training in Zen meditation could consistently establish Hemi-Sync at will, sustaining it for over 15 minutes." Dr. Stuart Twemlow, a psychiatrist and a research associate of the Monroe Institute, reports that: "In our studies of the effect of the Monroe tape system on brainwaves, we have found that the tapes encourage the focusing of brain energy ( i t can be measured as with a lightbulb, in watts) into a narrower and narrower 'frequency band'. This focusing of energy i s not unlike the yoga concept of one pointedness, which we may translate in western terms as a single-mindedness." Dr. Twemlow goes on to observe that as the individual gets into the tapes beyond Focus 3, "...there is a gradual increase in brainwave size which is a measure of brain energy or power."

	5.	Gateway 和 Hemi-Sync
现在我们已经简要概述了那些在目标和/或方法上与 Gateway 体验有部分相似的主要意识改变或扩展技术的基本机制，我们可以进一步聚焦于该技术的实际内容。根本上说，Gateway 体验是一种训练系统，旨在增强左右脑之间脑波输出的振幅和频率的强度、聚焦和一致性，以改变意识，使其超越物质领域，最终甚至突破时间和空间的限制。参与者可以因此接触到宇宙提供的各种直觉知识层次。Gateway 体验与其他形式的冥想的区别在于其使用了 Hemi-Sync 技术。根据门罗研究所培训师梅丽莎·雅格（Melissa Jager）在一篇专著中的定义，Hemi-Sync 是“当两个半球的脑电波模式在振幅和频率上同时相等时的意识状态”。尽管 Hemi-Sync 在普通人类意识中似乎相当罕见且持续时间较短，梅丽莎·雅格表示：

“由鲍勃·门罗开发的音频技术可以通过研究所的基础 Focus 3 磁带来诱导并维持 Hemi-Sync…”她还指出：

“门宁格基金会的埃尔默和艾丽斯·格林进行的研究表明，经过 20 年禅宗冥想训练的受试者可以自如地建立并维持 Hemi-Sync 超过 15 分钟。”

精神病学家兼门罗研究所研究员斯图尔特·特姆洛博士（Dr. Stuart Twemlow）报告称：“在我们对门罗磁带系统对脑电波影响的研究中，我们发现这些磁带促使脑能量集中（可以像灯泡一样用瓦特来测量）在越来越窄的‘频带’中。这种能量集中与瑜伽中的一心概念类似，我们可以用西方术语将其解释为一种专注的心态。”特姆洛博士进一步指出，当个体使用磁带超越 Focus 3 阶段时，“…脑波幅度逐渐增大，这是脑能量或功率的衡量标准。”

### 6. Lampv sLaser:

Melissa Jager uses a metaphor to help clarify the process involvedi ntheuse of Hemi-Sync in the Gateway Experience.
She points out that the human mind in its natural state may be likened to an ordinary lamp which expends energy in the form of both heat and light but in a chaotic, incoherent way which diffuses its energy over a wide area of rather limited depth. On the other hand, the human mind under the discipline of Hemi-Sync acts after the fashion of a laser beam which produces a disciplined stream of
light.
The stream of energy i s projected with total coherence of both frequency and amplitude such that the surface area of a laser beam contains billions of times the concentrated energy found in a similar surface area on the sun.
Gateway assumes that once the frequency and amplitude of the human brain are rendered coherent, it is possible to begin accelerating both so that the human mind is soon resonating at ever higher vibrational levels.
The mind can then bring it s e l f into sycronization with more sophisticated and rarified energy levels in the universe. The mind, when operating at these increasingly rarified levels is assumed to be capable of processing the information thus received through the same fundamental matrix by which it makes sense o f ordinary physical sensory input to achieve meaning in a cognitive context. Such meaning is usually perceived visually in the form of symbols but may also be perceived as astonishing flashes of holistic intuition or even in the form of scenarios involving both visual and aural perception.
The mechanics by which the mind exercises the consciousness function will be addressed in more detail
later in this paper.

	6.	灯与激光：梅丽莎·雅格使用了一个比喻来帮助阐明 Gateway 体验中 Hemi-Sync 的使用过程。她指出，处于自然状态的人类心灵可以比作一盏普通的灯，散发出的能量以热和光的形式呈现，但却是以一种混乱、无序的方式将能量分散在较广的区域，且深度有限。另一方面，在 Hemi-Sync 训练下的人类心灵则如同激光束，发射出一种经过调节的能量流。激光束的频率和振幅完全一致，因此其表面区域的能量集中度比太阳表面上的相似区域高出数十亿倍。

Gateway 认为，一旦人脑的频率和振幅达到一致，就可以开始加速二者，使人类心灵逐渐在更高的振动层次上共鸣。然后，心灵可以与宇宙中更精致、更稀薄的能量层次同步。当心灵在这些越来越稀薄的层次上运作时，据推测能够以接收物理感官输入时所用的基本框架来处理从中获取的信息，从而在认知情境中获得意义。这样的意义通常以符号形式视觉化地呈现，但也可能表现为令人惊叹的整体直觉闪现，甚至包括视觉和听觉体验的情境场景。

心灵如何通过意识功能来执行这些机制的细节将在本文稍后部分详述。

### 7. Frequency Following Response.

To achieve synchronization of brain hemispheres, the Hemi-Synctechnique takes advantage of a phenomenon known as the Frequency Following Response(FFR) which means that if a subject hears a sound produced at a frequency which emulates one of those associated with the operation of the human brain, the brain will try to mimick the same frequency pattern by adjusting its brainwave output.
Therefore, if the subject is in a fully awake state but hears sound frequencies which approximates brainwave output at the Theta level, the subject's brain will endeavor to alter its brainwave pattern from the normal Beta to the Theta level. Since the Theta level is associated with sleep, the subject concerned may progress from a fully awake to a sleep stateprovided that he does not consciously resist) as the brain strives to entrain its wave frequency output with the one which the person hears. Since these brainwave frequencies are outside the spectrum of sounds which can be heard in pure form by the human ear, 'Hemi-Sync must produce them based on another phenomenon known as the brain's capacity for deducing "beat" frequencies. If the human brain is exposed to one frequency in the left ear which is 10 Hertz below another audible frequency played in the right ear, rather than hearing either of the two audible frequencies, the brain chooses to "hear" the difference between them, the "beat" frequency. Thus, availing itself of the FFR phenomenon, and using the technique of "beat" frequencies, the Gateway system uses Hemi-Sync and other audio techniques employing the FFR phenomenon to introduce a variety of frequencies which are played at a virtually subliminal, marginally audible level. The objective is to relax the left hemisphere of the brain, place the physical body in a virtual sleep state, and bring the left and right hemispheres into coherence under conditions designed to promote the production of ever higher amplitude and frequency of brainwave output.
Audible and perhaps subliminal suggestions by Bob Monroe accompany the various brainwave frequencies, which are sometimes rolled in together with other sounds such as sea surf t o mask the sound frequencies where desireable. In this way, Gateway endeavors to provide the subject with the tools by which he may alter his consciousness based on his own volition over time through the repetitive use of the t a p e s so as to access, via intuitive means, new categories of information not available to ordinary consciousness.

	7.	频率跟随反应

为了实现脑半球的同步，Hemi-Sync 技术利用了一种称为“频率跟随反应”（Frequency Following Response，简称 FFR）的现象。这意味着如果一个人听到的声音频率与人脑活动的某种频率相似，脑部会尝试通过调整脑电波输出来模仿这种频率模式。因此，如果受试者处于完全清醒状态，但听到接近 Theta 水平的脑电波输出频率，受试者的大脑将尝试将其脑电波模式从正常的 Beta 频率转变为 Theta 频率。由于 Theta 水平与睡眠相关，因此受试者可能会在不主动抗拒的情况下，从清醒状态进入睡眠状态，因为大脑会努力使其波频率输出与所听到的频率同步。

由于这些脑电波频率超出了人类耳朵可以直接听到的纯声音频率范围，Hemi-Sync 必须基于另一种现象来产生这些频率，这种现象是大脑推断“拍频”的能力。如果人脑的左耳接收到一个频率，而右耳接收到另一个比该频率高出 10 赫兹的可听频率，大脑不会听到其中任何一个可听频率，而是选择“听到”它们之间的差，即“拍频”频率。因此，利用 FFR 现象并使用“拍频”技术，Gateway 系统通过 Hemi-Sync 和其他音频技术使用 FFR 现象，引入了一系列以接近听觉极限、边缘可听的水平播放的频率。其目的是放松大脑的左半球，使身体处于类似睡眠的状态，并在条件设计上促进更高振幅和频率的脑电波输出时，使左半球和右半球达到同步。

Bob Monroe 的可听或潜意识建议伴随各种脑电波频率，有时还与其他声音（如海浪声）混合在一起，以在需要时掩盖这些声音频率。通过这种方式，Gateway 试图为受试者提供工具，使其能够通过重复使用磁带，根据自己的意愿逐步改变意识，从而通过直觉方式接触到普通意识无法获得的新信息类别。

### 8. Role of Resonance.

However, brain coherence through entrainment to "beat" frequencies introduced via stereo headphones is only part of the reason why the Gateway system works. I t i s also designed to achieve the physical quietude characteristic of deep transcendental meditative states which brings abouta complete alteration of the fundamental resonance pattern associated with the sound frequencies produced by the human body. Yoga, zen or transcendental meditation, if practiced long enough, will produce a change in the sound frequency with which the human heart resonates throughout the entire body. According to Bentov, this change in resonance results from elimination of what the medical profession calls "the bifurcation echo" so that the sound of the heartbeat can move synchronously up and down the circulatory system in harmonious resonance approximately seven times a second. Bentov describes the roll played by the bifurcation echo as follows:
"When the left ventricle of the heart ejects blood, the aorta, being elastic, balloons out just beyond the valve and causes a pressure pulse to travel down along the aorta.
When the pressure pulse reaches the bifurcation in the lower abdomen (which is where the aorta forks in two to go into the legs), part of the pressure pulse rebounds and starts traveling up the aorta. If in the meantime the heart ejects more blood, and a new pressure pulse is traveling down, these two pressure points will eventually collide somewhere along the aorta and produce an interference pattern." By placing the body in a sleeplike state, the Gateway tapes achieve the same goal as meditation in that it places the body in such a profoundly relaxed state that the bifurcation echo slowly fades away as the heart lessens the force and frequency with which it pushes blood into the aorta. The result is a regular, rhythmic sinewave pattern of sound which echoes throughout the body and rises up into the head in sustained resonance.
The amplitude of this sinewave pattern, when measured with a sensitive, seismograph type instrument is about three times the average of the sound volume produced by the heart when i t is operating normally.

	8.	共振的作用

然而，通过立体耳机引入的“拍频”频率使大脑同步只是 Gateway 系统起作用的一部分原因。它还旨在实现深层超然冥想状态的身体平静，这会导致与人体产生的声音频率相关的基本共振模式完全改变。瑜伽、禅修或超然冥想如果长时间练习，都会改变人类心脏在全身共振的声音频率。根据 Bentov 的理论，这种共振变化源于消除医学上所称的“分叉回声”，使心跳的声音以每秒约七次的频率同步在循环系统中上下传播。Bentov 描述了分叉回声的作用如下：“当心脏左心室射出血液时，主动脉由于具有弹性，在阀门外侧膨胀，产生的压力脉冲沿主动脉向下传播。当压力脉冲到达下腹部的分叉点（即主动脉分叉成两部分进入双腿的地方）时，部分压力脉冲反弹并开始向上传播。如果此时心脏再次射出血液并向下产生一个新的压力脉冲，这两个压力点最终将在主动脉的某处相遇并产生干涉图案。”

通过将身体置于类似睡眠的状态，Gateway 磁带实现了与冥想相同的目标，将身体置于一种深度放松的状态，使分叉回声逐渐消失，因为心脏减少了将血液推入主动脉的力量和频率。其结果是在全身产生一种规律、节奏性的正弦波声音模式，并在头部持续共振。当使用敏感的地震仪类型仪器测量这种正弦波模式的振幅时，发现它约为心脏正常运行时产生的声音音量的三倍。

### 9. Brain Stimulation.

Bentov's biomedical model shows that this resonance is of considerable importance since it is directly transmitted to and impacts upon the brain.
The resulting vibration is received and transmitted into the brain itself viathe fluidfilledthirdandleftventricleslocatedabovethe brainstem.An electromagnetic pulse is then generated which stimulates the brain to raise the amplitude and frequency of brainwave output, just as Dr. Iwemlow observed in his researchonthe effects of the Hemi-Synctapes. Also, the brain is contained in a tight membrane called the dura which is, in turn, cushioned by a thin layer of fluid located between it and the skull. As the coherent resonance produced by the human heart in a state of profound relaxation reaches the fluid layer surrounding the brain, it sets up a rhythmic pattern in which the brain moves up and down approximately 0.005 to 0.010 millimeters in a continuous pattern.
The selfreinforcing character of resonant behavior accounts for the body's ability to sustain this movement despite the minimal level of energy involved.
In this way, the entire body, based on its own micromotion, functions as a tuned vibrational system which transfers energy in a range of between 6.8 and 7.5 Hertz into the earth's ionospheric cavity, which itself resonates at about 7-7.5 Hertz. Of this process, Bentov states:
"This is occurring at a very long wavelength of about 40,000 Km, or just about the perimeter of the planet.
In other words, the signal from the movement of our bodies will travel around the world in about one seventh of a second through the electrostatic field in which we are imbedded. Such a long wavelength knows no obstacles, and its strength does not attenuate much over large distances. Naturally it will go through just about anything: metal, concrete, water, and the fields making up our bodies. It is the ideal medium for conveying a telepathic signal."
Consequently, the Gateway process is designed to rather rapidly induce a state of profound calm within the nervous system and to significantly lower blood pressure to cause the circulatory system, skeleton and all other physical organ systems to begin vibrating coherently at approximately 7-7.5 cycles per second. The resulting resonance sets up a regular, repetitive sound wave which propagates in consonance with the elecrostatic field of the earth.

	9.	大脑刺激

Bentov 的生物医学模型显示，这种共振具有相当的重要性，因为它直接传递并影响大脑。产生的振动通过大脑干上方的充满液体的第三和左侧脑室传入大脑本身。然后产生一个电磁脉冲，刺激大脑提高脑波输出的振幅和频率，正如 Iwemlow 博士在其关于 Hemi-Sync 磁带效应的研究中所观察到的。此外，大脑被一个称为硬脑膜的紧密膜状结构包裹，硬脑膜与头骨之间有一层薄薄的液体缓冲。当人类心脏在深度放松状态下产生的协调共振到达包围大脑的液体层时，会形成一种有节奏的模式，使大脑以约 0.005 到 0.010 毫米的幅度上下运动。这种共振行为的自我增强特性解释了即使能量水平极低，身体也能维持这种运动的能力。

这样，整个身体基于自身的微运动，作为一个调谐的振动系统，向地球的电离层腔传递 6.8 到 7.5 赫兹范围的能量，而地球的电离层腔本身共振频率大约在 7 到 7.5 赫兹之间。对此过程，Bentov 表示：“这种情况发生在约 40000 公里的极长波长下，几乎等于地球的周长。换句话说，我们身体运动产生的信号会在约七分之一秒内通过我们所嵌入的静电场环绕全球传播。如此长的波长无视障碍，强度在长距离上几乎不衰减。自然，它几乎可以穿透任何物质：金属、混凝土、水以及构成我们身体的场。这是传递心灵感应信号的理想媒介。”

因此，Gateway 过程旨在相当迅速地在神经系统内诱导一种深度平静状态，并显著降低血压，使循环系统、骨骼以及其他所有物理器官系统开始在大约 7-7.5 周期每秒的频率下协调振动。产生的共振形成一种规则的、重复的声波，与地球的静电场共鸣传播。

### 10. Energy Entrainment.

As the body is turned into a coherent oscillator vibrating in harmony with the surrounding electrostatic medium, the specific exercises included in the Gateway tapes enjoin the participant to build up the energy field surrounding his body, presumably by using energy from the earth's field which the body is now entraining because of its ability to resonate with it. This puts the body's energy field into homogeneity with its surrounding environment and promotes movement of the seat of consciousness into the surrounding environment partly in response to the fact that the two electromagnetic medians are now a single energy continuum. Thus, the same process which moves the brain into focused coherence at steadily higher levels of frequency and amplitude so as to entrain analgous frequencies in the universe for data collection also promotes enhancement of bodily energy levels to a point adequate to permit the subject to experience an out-of-body movement when he is ready to do so(more will be said about this topic later). In addition, by resonating with the earth's electromagnetic sphere the human body creates a surprisingly powerful carrier wave to assist the mind in communication activity with other human minds similarly tuned.

	10.	能量同步

当身体变成一个与周围静电介质谐振的协调振荡器时，Gateway 磁带中的特定练习要求参与者增强围绕身体的能量场，据推测是通过利用地球场的能量来实现的，因为身体现在能够与之共振。这使得身体的能量场与其周围环境达到同质性，并促进意识的座位向周围环境移动，部分原因在于这两个电磁介质现在成为了一个单一的能量连续体。因此，这一过程不仅让大脑在逐渐提高的频率和振幅水平上聚焦，还能在宇宙中同步到类似频率以获取数据，同时也增强身体的能量水平，使主体在准备好时能体验出体的移动（关于这一主题将进一步讨论）。

此外，通过与地球的电磁场共振，人类身体会创造一个相当强大的载波来协助心灵在与其他同样调谐的人类心灵进行沟通时发挥作用。

### 11. Consciousness and Energy.

Before our explanation can proceed any further, it is essential to define the mechanism by which the human mind exercises the function known as consciousness, and to describe the way in which that consciousness operates to deduce meaning from the stimuli which it receives. To do this, we will first consider the fundamental character of the material world in which we have our physical existence in order to accurately perceive the raw stuff with which our consciousness must work. The first point which needs to be made is that the two terms, matter and energy tend to be misleading if taken to indicate two distinctly different states of existence in the physical world that we know it. Indeed, if the term matter is taken to mean solid substance as opposed to energy which is understood to mean a force of some sort, then the use of the former is entirely misleading.
Science now knows that both the electrons which spin in the energy field located around the nucleus of the atom and the nucleus itself are made up of nothing more than oscillating energy grids.
Solid matter, in the strict construction of the term, simply does not exist.. Rather, atomic structure is composed of oscillating energy grids surrounded by other oscillating energy grids which orbit at extraordinarily high speeds. In his book, Stalking the wild Pendulum, Itzhak Bentov gives the following figures. The energy grid which composes the nucleus of the atom vibrates at approximately 1022 Hertz(which means 10 followed by 22 zeros). At 70 degrees Farenheit an atom oscillates at the rate of 1015 Hertz.
An entire molecule, composed of a number of atoms bound together in a single energy field vibrates in the range of 109 Hertz. Alive human cell vibrates at approximately 103 Hertz.
The point to be made is that the entire human being, brain, consciousness and all is, like the universe which surrounds him, nothing more or less than an extraordinarily complex system of energy fields. The so called states of matter are actually variances in the state of energy, and human consciousness is a function of the interaction of energy in two opposite states(motion vs rest) in a manner described in the following paragraph.

	11.	意识与能量

在我们进一步解释之前，有必要定义人类心智行使“意识”这一功能的机制，并描述意识如何通过所接收的刺激推断意义。为此，我们首先考虑物质世界的基本特性——我们在其中拥有物理存在，以便准确地理解意识必须工作的原始材料。首先需要指出的是，如果将“物质”和“能量”视为物理世界中两种截然不同的存在状态，这两个术语往往会产生误导。事实上，如果“物质”被理解为固体物质，而“能量”被理解为某种力量，那么前者的使用完全是误导性的。科学现在已经知道，围绕原子核的电子场以及原子核本身仅仅是振荡的能量网格。严格来说，固体物质并不存在。相反，原子结构由振荡的能量网格组成，周围是以极高速度运行的其他振荡能量网格。

Itzhak Bentov 在他的著作《Stalking the Wild Pendulum》中给出了以下数据：组成原子核的能量网格的振动频率约为 10^22 赫兹（即 10 后跟 22 个零）。在 70 华氏度下，原子的振荡频率为 10^15 赫兹。由多个原子组成的整个分子振动频率在 10^9 赫兹的范围内。活细胞的振动频率约为 10^3 赫兹。重点在于，整个生命体，包括大脑和意识，与其所处的宇宙一样，仅仅是一个极其复杂的能量场系统。所谓的物质状态实际上是能量状态的不同，而人类意识则是两种相反状态（运动与静止）之间能量相互作用的产物。

### 12. Holograms.

Energy creates, stores and retrieves meaning in the universe by projecting or expanding at certain frequencies in a three dimensional mode that creates a living pattern called a hologram. The concept of the hologram can be most easily understood by using an example cited by Bentov in which he asks the reader to visualize a bowl full of water into which three pebbles are dropped.
As the ripples created by the simultaneous entry of the three pebbles radiate outward towards the rim of the bowl, Bentov further asks the reader to visualize that the surface of the water is suddenly flash frozen so that the ripple pattern is preserved instantly.
The ice is removed leaving the three pebbles still laying at the bottom of the bowl. Then the ice is exposed to a powerful, coherent source of light, such as a laser. The result will be a three dimensional model or representation of the position of the three pebbles suspended in midair. Holograms are capable of encoding so much detail that, for example, it is possible t o take a holographic projection of a glass of swamp water and view it under magnification to see small organisms not visible to the naked eye when the glass of water itself is examined. The whole concept of holography, despite its scientific implications, has only been known to the physicist since the underlying mathmatical principles were worked out by Dennis Gabor in 1947(he later won a Nobel Prize for his work).

Laboratory demonstration of Gabor's work only occurred years later following invention of the laser. As biologist Lyall Watson explains:
"The purest kind of light available to us is that produced by a laser, which sends out a beam in which all the waves are of one frequency, like those made by an ideal pebble in a perfect pond. When two laser beams touch, they produce an interference pattern of light and dark ripples that can be recorded on a photographic plate . And if one of the beams, instead of coming directly from the laser, is reflected first off an object such as a human face, the resulting pattern will be very complex indeed, but it can still be recorded. The record will be a hologram of the face."

	12.	全息图

能量通过以特定频率在三维模式中投射或扩展，来创造、储存和检索宇宙中的意义，从而形成一种被称为全息图的动态模式。可以通过 Bentov 提出的一个例子来简单地理解全息图的概念，他让读者想象一碗水，同时放入三颗小石子。随着三颗小石子同时入水，产生的涟漪向碗的边缘扩散，Bentov 接着要求读者想象水面瞬间被闪电般的冷冻，使得涟漪图案立刻被保留下来。然后，冰被取出，三颗小石子仍然留在碗底。此时将冰块置于一个强大的相干光源（例如激光）照射下，结果会出现一个三维模型或悬浮在空中的三颗小石子的位置的图像。

全息图具有编码大量细节的能力。例如，可以通过全息投影观察一杯沼泽水，并在放大镜下看到在裸眼检查时看不见的小生物。尽管全息学概念具有深远的科学意义，但物理学家直到 Dennis Gabor 在 1947 年计算出相关数学原理后才了解该概念（他后来因此获得诺贝尔奖）。Gabor 的工作在激光发明后才得以在实验室中演示。生物学家 Lyall Watson 解释道：“我们所能获得的最纯净的光是由激光产生的光束，其中所有波都是一个频率，就像一个理想的小石子在完美的池塘中产生的波。当两束激光接触时，它们会产生一种由明暗波纹组成的干涉图案，可以记录在感光板上。而如果其中一束激光在直接来自激光器之前首先被一个物体（例如人脸）反射，则产生的图案会非常复杂，但仍然可以记录下来。这种记录将成为该面部的全息图。”

### 13. The Part Encodes the whole.

Of further importance is the fact that even if we dropped our frozen hologram of the ripple pattern on the floor and broke it into a number of pieces each individual piece would recreate the entire holographic image all by itself. The smaller the piece, the fuzzier and more distorted would be the resulting holographic projection but the fact remains that a whole projection would nonetheless be made.
The key to creating any hologram is that energy in motion must interact with energy in a state of rest(nonmotion). In the foregoing example, the pebbles represent energy in motion while the water(before its agitation by the pebbles) represents energy at a state of rest. To activate or, in effect, to "perceive" the meaning of a holograph, energy(in this case, a coherent light source such as a laser beam) must be passed through the interference pattern generated by interaction between the moving energy and the energy at rest. In the simple example given by Bentov, this requirement was fulfilled by holding the frozen interference pattern in front of the coherent light to project the three dimensional holographic image(its "meaning") into space. As Marilyn Ferguson, editor of the Brain/MindBulletin tells us:
"Another feature of a hologram is its efficiency. Billions of bits of information can be stored in a tiny space. The pattern of the holographic [photograph]...is stored everywhere on the plate."

	13.	部分包含整体

更为重要的是，即使我们将冷冻的波纹全息图打碎成多个碎片，每一块碎片也能够单独重现完整的全息图像。碎片越小，生成的全息投影就越模糊和失真，但事实是，仍能形成一个完整的投影。创建任何全息图的关键在于运动中的能量必须与处于静止状态的能量相互作用。在上述示例中，小石子代表运动中的能量，而水（在石子扰动前）代表静止状态的能量。要激活或“感知”全息图的含义，必须将能量（在此情况下为激光束等相干光源）通过由运动能量和静止能量相互作用产生的干涉图案。

在 Bentov 给出的简单示例中，将冷冻干涉图案置于相干光源前投射出三维全息图像（即其“意义”）满足了这一要求。正如《Brain/Mind Bulletin》的编辑 Marilyn Ferguson 所说：“全息图的另一个特点是其高效性。数十亿比特的信息可以储存在一个小空间中。全息[照片]的图案…存储在感光板的每一处。”

### 14. The Consciousness Matrix.

The universe is composed of interacting energy fields, some at rest and sone in motion. It is, in and of itself, one gigantic hologram of unbelievable complexity. According to the theories of Karl Pribram, a neuroscientist at Stanford University and David Bohm, a physicist at the University of London, the human mind i s also a hologram which attunes itself t o the universal hologram by the medium of energy exchange thereby deducing meaning and achieving the s t a t e which we c a l l consciousness. With respect to states of expanded or alteredconsciousness such as Gateway uses, the process operates in the following way•
As energy passes through various aspects of the universal hologram and is perceived by the electrostatic fields which comprise the human mind, the holographic images being conveyed are projected upon those electrostatic fields of the mind and are perceived or understood to the extent that the electrostatic field is operating at a frequency and amplitude that can harmonize with and therefore "read" the energy carrier wave pattern passing through it. Changes in the frequency and amplitude of the electrostatic field which comprises the human mind determines the configuration and hence the character of the holographic energy matrix which the mind projects to intercept meaning directly from the holographic transmissions of the universe.
Then, to make sense of what the holographic image is "saying" to it, the mind proceeds to compare the image just received with itself. Specifically, it does this by comparing the image received with that part o f its own hologram which constitutes memory.
By registering differences in geometric form and in energy frequency, the consciousness perceives(see Exhibit 2, next page) .
As psychologist Keith Floyd puts it:
"Contrary to what everyone knows is so, it may not be the brain that produces consciousness--but rather, consciousness that creates the appearance of the brain..."

	14.	意识矩阵

宇宙是由相互作用的能量场组成的，其中一些是静止的，一些是运动的。就其本身而言，宇宙是一个复杂到难以想象的巨大全息图。根据斯坦福大学的神经科学家卡尔·普里布拉姆（Karl Pribram）和伦敦大学物理学家大卫·玻姆（David Bohm）的理论，人类的思想也是一个全息图，通过能量交换的媒介调谐到宇宙全息图，从而推导出意义，并实现我们称之为意识的状态。

对于像 Gateway 这样的扩展或改变的意识状态，这一过程如下：当能量穿过宇宙全息图的各个方面，并被构成人体思想的静电场感知时，全息图像被投射到思想的静电场上，并被感知或理解——只要这些静电场的频率和幅度可以与之协调，从而能够“读取”通过的能量载波模式。构成思想的静电场的频率和幅度的变化决定了思想所投射的全息能量矩阵的配置，因此也决定了思想所接收的来自宇宙全息图传递的意义。

为了理解全息图像所“传达”的内容，思想会将接收到的图像与自身的记忆全息图相比较。具体而言，它通过比较几何形状和能量频率的差异来感知（见下一页的图表2）。正如心理学家基思·弗洛伊德（Keith Floyd）所说：“与人们普遍认为的相反，可能不是大脑产生了意识，而是意识创造了大脑的表象。”

### 15. Brain inphase :

The consciousness process is most easily envisaged if we picture theholographic input with a three dimensional grid system superimposed overit suchthatalloftheenergy patterns contained within canbedescribed in terms of three dimensional geometry using mathmatics to reduce the data to two dimensional form.
Bentov states that scientists suspect that the human mind operates on a simple binary "go/no go" system as do all digital computers. Therefore, once it superimposes a three dimensional matrix over holographic information it wishes to interpret and reduces that information mathmatically t o two dimensional form, it can completely process it using it s fundamental binary system just as any computer made by the hand of man can process volumes of data and make various comparisons between the data and information stored in its digital memory.
Our minds operate in the same way, perceiving by comparison only.
Bentov states the proposition this way: "Our whole reality is constructed by constantly making such comparisons....Whenever we perceive something, we always perceive differences only." In states of expanded consciousness, the right hemisphere of thehuman brain in its holistic, nonlinear and nonverbal mode of functioning acts as the primary matrix or receptor for this holographic input while, by operating in phase or coherence with the right brain, the left hemisphere provides the secondary matrix through its binary, computer-like method of functioning to screen further the data by comparison and reduce it to a discreet, two dimensional form.

	15.	大脑同步状态

意识过程可以更容易地理解，如果我们把全息输入想象为一个覆盖在三维网格系统上的信息集合，其中的所有能量模式都可以用三维几何来描述，并通过数学将数据简化为二维形式。Bentov 认为，科学家们怀疑人类大脑像所有数字计算机一样，基于简单的二进制“开/关”系统运作。因此，一旦大脑将三维矩阵叠加在它想要解释的全息信息上，并将这些信息数学上简化为二维形式，它就可以用其基本的二进制系统来完全处理这些信息，就像任何人类制造的计算机可以处理大量数据并在数据和存储于其数字记忆中的信息之间进行各种比较一样。

我们的思想也是通过比较来感知世界。Bentov 将其观点概括为：“我们的整个现实是通过不断进行此类比较构建起来的……每当我们感知到某物时，我们总是仅感知到差异。”在扩展意识状态中，大脑右半球以整体、非线性和非语言的模式运作，作为接收全息输入的主要矩阵；而当右脑与左脑处于相位或相干状态时，左脑通过其类似计算机的二进制运作模式提供次要矩阵，进一步通过比较筛选数据，并将其简化为离散的二维形式。

### 16. Evaluation.

To the extent that Gateway succeeds i n bringing about a refinementi nenergy matrix of the mind, it succeeds in expanding or altering human consciousness so that it can perceive without recourse to the intercession of the physical senses such that ever more of the universal hologram(not, of course, accessible by sense perception) can ultimately be perceived and understood.
Marilyn Ferguson has written that the theories of Pribram and Bohm "appear to" account for all transcendental experience, paranormal events and even "normal perceptual oddities.." She goes on to say of Pribram:
"Currently he i s proposing a startling , all-encompassing model that is generating considerable excitement among those intrigued by the mysteries of human consciousness.
His "holographic model" marries brain research to theoretical physics; it accounts for normal perception and simultaneously takes the paranormal and transcende.ntal experiences out of the supernatural by explaining them as a part of nature
Like certain strange discoveries of quantum physics, the radical reorientation of this theory sudde"nly makes sense of paradoxical sayings of mystics throughout the ages.

	16.	评估

在某种程度上，Gateway 能够成功地细化心灵的能量矩阵，扩展或改变人类意识，使其能够无需依赖物理感官的中介而感知，从而最终可以理解和感知更多的宇宙全息图（当然，这些信息并不能通过感官直接获取）。Marilyn Ferguson 曾撰文指出，Pribram 和 Bohm 的理论“似乎可以”解释所有的超验体验、超自然现象，甚至一些“正常的知觉异常”。她进一步评论 Pribram 说：“目前，他正在提出一个令人震惊的、全方位的模型，这个模型在那些对人类意识之谜感兴趣的人群中引发了极大的关注。他的‘全息模型’将脑研究与理论物理结合起来；它不仅解释了正常的知觉现象，还通过将超自然现象和超验体验解释为自然的一部分，消除了其神秘性。就像量子物理学中的一些奇异发现一样，这一理论的激进重构让历代神秘主义者的悖论性言论顿时显得有了道理。”

### 17. Self Cognition.

To complete our outline of the process by which the mind achieves and exercises consciousness, we must also describe the mechanism which accounts for the aspect of human thought that differentiates it from the consciousness of plants or animals, i . e . self cognition. Humans not only know, but they know that they know. They are able to monitor the process of their own thinking and maintain an awareness of it. Moreover, they can conduct a comparitive assessment, evaluating the functioning of their thought processes against various "objective" standards they have adopted. Human consciousness can do this because it has the capacity to duplicate aspects of its own hologram, project them out, "perceive" that projection, put it through comparison with the memory aspect(where its evaluation standards of measure are stored) of its own hologram, and measure or "sense" the differences using three dimensional geometry and then binary "go/no go" pulse to yield verbal cognition about the self.

	17.	自我认知

为完成对心智如何实现和运用意识的过程的描述，我们还必须解释一种独特机制——它决定了人类思维区别于植物或动物意识的那一面，即自我认知。人类不仅能够知晓事物，还能意识到自己在知晓。他们能够监控自己的思维过程，并对其保持自觉。此外，他们能够进行对比评估，将自己的思维过程与各种“客观”标准相比较。人类意识之所以能够做到这一点，是因为它具有复制自身全息图部分的能力，能将这些部分投射出去，“感知”该投射，再将其与记忆部分（存储有评价标准）进行比较，并使用三维几何和二进制“通过/不通过”脉冲来计算差异，从而产生关于自我的语言认知。

### 18. Time-Space Dimension.

Up to this point our discussion of the Gateway process has been relatively simple and easy to follow. Now the fun begins. Gateway involves more than just perception of those aspects of the universal hologram which can be accessed in the dimension of time-space as we know it. To explain how and why human consciousness can be brought to transcend the limitations of time-space is the next task which must be addressed. To do this we must first appreciate what time and space are in order to understand how the dimension that they constitute energy to be in motion it must first be limited in some way within the confines of some sort of vibratory pattern so that its confinement gives it the capacity for being contained at a specific location which is distinguishable from other locations(space).
Energy which i s not confined i s force without limit, without dimension, without the limits of form. It is infinity, cannot move because there is nothing beyond infinity, and is therefore outside of the dimension of time.
It is also beyond space because that concept implies that a specific energy form is limited to a specific location, and is absent from other locations.
But i f energy is in the state of infinity, there are no boundaries, no "here" to differentiate from "there", no sense of area.
Energy in infinity means energy uniformly extended without limit.
It has no beginning, no end, no location. It i s conscious force, the fundamental, primal power of existence without form, a state of infinite
being.
Energy in infinity is said to be completely at rest and, therefore, cannot generate holograms so long as it remains utterly inactive.
It retains its inherent capacity for consciousness in that it can receive and passively perceive holograms generated by energy in motion out in the various dimensions which make up the created universe but it cannot be perceived by consciousness operating in the active universe.
Energy in this state of inactive infinity is termed by physicists as energy in its absolute state, or simply "the Absolute." Between the Absolute and the "material" universe in which we experience our physical existence are various intervening dimensions to which human consciousness in altered states of being may gain access. Theoretically, human consciousness may continue to expand the horizons of its perceptual capability until it reaches the dimension of the Absolute at which point perception stops because the Absolute generates no holograms of or about itself.

	18.	时空维度

至此，我们对“Gateway”过程的讨论还相对简单且易于理解。但接下来是更为复杂的部分。“Gateway”不仅仅涉及对那些可在我们所知的时空维度中接触到的普遍全息图的感知。下一个任务是解释人类意识如何以及为何能够超越时空的限制。为此，我们首先需要理解时间和空间的本质，以明白它们如何构成一个使能量得以运动的维度。

能量要实现运动，必须被某种振动模式限制在某个特定范围内，使其具备在特定位置上被“包含”的能力，从而能被区分为“某处”（即空间）与“他处”。而未被限制的能量则是无限的力量，无限且无形式的力量。它没有维度、没有形状，是无限的，不存在任何“之外”，因此也不存在时间的概念。它也超越了空间，因为空间隐含着能量形式局限于特定位置而不存在于其他位置的概念。然而，对于处于无限状态的能量，没有边界，没有“这里”与“那里”的区别，亦无空间的概念。

无限中的能量意味着没有任何限制的均匀扩展。它没有起点，没有终点，没有具体位置，是一种没有形式的存在的最初之力。这种无限的能量据说完全处于静止状态，因此在保持绝对静止的情况下无法生成全息图。尽管它具有潜在的意识，因为它能够被动地接收并感知由运动中的能量在宇宙维度中生成的全息图，但活跃于物质宇宙中的意识却无法感知这种无限静止的能量。物理学家称这种静止的无限能量为“绝对态”或“绝对”。

在“绝对态”与我们体验物理存在的“物质”宇宙之间，存在着各种中介维度，人类的意识在进入某种改变状态时可以接触到这些维度。理论上，人的意识可以不断扩展其感知能力的边界，直至达到“绝对态”的维度，此时感知将停止，因为绝对态并不生成有关自身的全息图。

### 19. Intervening dimensions.

Since the Absolute is conscious energy in infinity ( i . e . without boundaries), it occupies every dimension to include the time-space dimension in which we have our physical existence but we cannot perceive it. It overlays everything as do many of the intervening gradients or dimensions through which the energies of the universe pass on their way to and from their home in the state of infinity(the Absolute) • To enter these intervening dimensions, human consciousness must focus with such intense coherence that the frequency of the energy pattern which comprises that consciousness(i.e. the brainwave output) can accelerate to the point where the resulting frequency pattern, if displayed on an oscilloscope, would look virtually like a solid line. Achievement of this state of altered consciousness sets the stage for perception of non-time-space dimensions because of the operation of a principle in physics known as Planck's Distance.

This is an aspect of quantum mechanics which applies to the fact that any oscillating frequency(such as a brainwave) reaches two points of complete rest which constitute the boundaries of each individual oscillation(i.e. movement up or down). Without these points of rest, an oscillating wave pattern would be impossible since the points of rest are required to permit the energy to change direction and thus continue vibrating between rigid limits. But it is also true that when, for an infinitesimally brief instant, that energy reaches one of its two p o i n t s o f rest it "clicks out" of time-space and joins infinity(see Exhibit 3, next page). That critical step out of time-space occurs when the speed of the oscillation drops below 10-33 centimeters per second(Planck's Distance). To use the words of Bentov: go below
". . . quantum mechanics tell us that when distances Planck's Distance, which is 10-33 CM, we enter, in effect, a new world." To return to our case in point, the human consciousness wave pattern reaches such high frequency that the pattern of "clickouts" comes so close together that there is virtual continuity in it.
Then, a portion of that consciousness is actually postulated t o establish and maintain its information collection function in those dimensions located between time-space and the Absolute.
Thus, as the almost continuous "clickout" pattern establishes itself in continuous phase at speeds below Planck's Distance but before reaching the state of total rest, human consciousness passes through the looking glass of time-space after the fashion of Alice beginning her journey into wonderland.
The Gateway experience, with its associated Hemi-Sync technique, is apparently designed, if used systematically and patiently, to enable human consciousness to establish a coherent pattern of perception in those dimensions where speeds below Planck's distance apply.
This holds true irrespective of whether the individual is exercising his consciousness while in his physical body or whether he is doing so after having separated that consciousness from the physical body(i.e. the so called out-of-body state mentioned earlier).

	19.	介入维度

由于“绝对态”是无限中的有意识能量（即没有边界），它遍布所有维度，包括我们物理存在的时空维度，但我们无法感知到它。它覆盖一切，就像宇宙中的许多能量在往返于“无限”状态（即“绝对态”）的过程中经过的多个渐变维度一样。要进入这些中介维度，人类意识必须极度专注，达到一种高度的相干性，使组成该意识的能量频率（即脑电波输出）加速到一个程度，以至于若在示波器上显示出来，几乎会呈现为一条实线。

这种改变意识状态的达成为感知非时空维度奠定了基础，这得益于物理学中的一个原理，即普朗克距离。这是量子力学的一个方面，适用于任何振荡频率（例如脑电波）会到达两个完全静止的点，它们构成了每次振荡的边界（即上下移动的界限）。没有这些静止点，振荡波模式将无法存在，因为这些点允许能量改变方向，从而在严格的限度内继续振动。也正是如此，当能量在微不足道的短暂瞬间到达其两个静止点之一时，它会从时空中“退出”并与“无限”状态连接（见下页的图3）。这种关键的“退出”时空的步骤发生在振荡速度降至每秒10^-33厘米（即普朗克距离）以下时。引用本托夫的话：“量子力学告诉我们，当距离小于普朗克距离（即10^-33厘米）时，我们实际上进入了一个新世界。”

回到我们的核心论点，当人类意识的波动频率达到如此之高，以至于“退出”模式变得接近连续时，这种“退出”便形成了几乎不间断的模式。于是，部分意识实际上被假设能在那些位于时空与“绝对态”之间的维度中建立和维持信息收集的功能。因此，当这种几乎连续的“退出”模式在低于普朗克距离但未完全达到静止状态的速度下实现连续的相位时，人类意识便可以穿越时空的“镜子”，如同《爱丽丝梦游仙境》中的爱丽丝开始她的奇幻旅程。

据推测，“Gateway”体验及其相关的“半球同步”技术是有意设计的，如果使用者有系统地且耐心地使用，将使人类意识在那些低于普朗克距离的维度中建立一个相干的感知模式。这种情况无论是个体在物理身体中行使其意识，还是在分离出其意识（即所谓的“体外状态”）后进行，都适用。

### 20. Subatomic Particles.

The behavior of subatomic particles provides an interestingexampleo fthe phenomenon of "clicking out" discussed in the preceding paragraphs.
In an article prepared for ScienceDigest magazine, Dr. John Gliedman mentions the way in which subatomic p a r t i c l e s communicate with each other once their energy fields become entrained as a result of colliding with each other.
The communication concerned is, of course, postulated to be occurring during the "click out phase" in the oscillation of the energy fields comprising the subatomic particles concerned.
It is this cause which accounts for the cross-communication at what in terms of time-space velocities, would seem to involve speeds in excess of light.
In reality Einstein's Theory of Relativity is not being invalidated but, rather, the communication concerned is taking place outside the dimension of time-space t o which the Theory of Relativity is strictly confined. Specifically, Dr. Gleidman t e l l s us: "Quantum theory postulates a kind of long range Siamese twin effect whenever two subatomic particles collide and then go their different ways. Even when the particles are halfway across the universe from each other, it says, they instantaneously respond to each other's actions. And in so doing, they violate relativity's ban on faster than light velocities." Indeed , regarding attempts to quantify what is known about the behavior of energy in dimensions apparently outside of time-space, Bentov speaks about, "...courageous physicists who are working on hypothetical particles, called 'tachyons,' which can move at speeds higher than light. The speed of tachyons starts just above the speed of light and ranges all the way to infinite velocities."

	20.	亚原子粒子

亚原子粒子的行为为前述的“退出”现象提供了一个有趣的例证。在《科学文摘》杂志的一篇文章中，约翰·格莱德曼博士提到，一旦亚原子粒子的能量场因相互碰撞而变得同步，这些粒子之间会进行某种通信。这种通信被假设发生在组成这些亚原子粒子的能量场振荡的“退出阶段”中。正是这个过程解释了为何这种通信会跨越时空，在看似超光速的情况下进行。实际上，爱因斯坦的相对论并未被否定，而是因为这种通信发生在严格局限于相对论的时空维度之外。

具体而言，格莱德曼博士表示：“量子理论假设，每当两个亚原子粒子发生碰撞并朝不同方向移动时，便会产生一种远程的‘连体效应’。即使两个粒子位于宇宙的不同角落，它们也会瞬时响应彼此的动作，从而违反了相对论中对超光速的限制。”事实上，在试图量化时空维度之外的能量行为时，本托夫提到，“一些勇敢的物理学家正在研究假设中的‘快子’——一种速度可以超过光速的粒子。快子的速度从略高于光速开始，一直到无限速度。”

### 21. Dimensions In-between.

Now that we have postulated the legitimacy of the assertion that the energy forms which compose consciousness can move beyond the time-space dimension, we need to turn our attention to the energy forms which inhabit those dimensions between time-space and the Absolute. In so doing, we may better perceive the form that "reality" assumes when we encounter it in those intermediate dimensions. In this context, Bentov tells us that:
"The causal relationship between events breaks down; movements become jerky rather than smooth.
Time and space may become "grainy" or "chunky." Perhaps a piece of space can be traversed by a particle of matter in any direction without necessarily being synchronized with a piece of time. In short, a pair of events will occur in either time or space, the pair not being connected causally but by a random fluctuation."
What Bentov means is that inside the dimension of time-space where both concepts apply in a generally uniform way there is a proportional relationship between them. A certain space can be covered by energy moving in either particle or wave form in a certain time assuming a specific velocity virtually anywhere in the time-space universe.
The relationship i s neat and predictable.
However, in the intermediate dimensions beyond time-space the limitations imposed on energy to put it into a state of oscillating motion are not uniform as they are in our physical universe.
Amyriad of various distortions and incongruities are thus likely to be encountered such that our nice neat assumptions concerning the relationship between timeand space as we know it in this dimension do not apply.
But even more important, access is opened to both the past and the future when the dimension of current time-space i s left behind.

	21.	中间维度

既然我们已假设意识构成的能量形式可以超越时空维度，那么接下来需要关注那些存在于时空与“绝对”之间的能量形式。通过这种方式，我们可以更好地理解在这些中间维度中遇到的“现实”形态。在此背景下，本托夫指出：“事件之间的因果关系会崩溃；运动变得不再平滑，而是断断续续的。时间和空间可能变得‘颗粒状’或‘块状’。也许物质粒子可以在任意方向上穿越一块空间，而不一定同步于时间的一部分。简而言之，一对事件可能会发生在时间或空间中，但这对事件不是因果连接，而是通过随机波动联系在一起。”

本托夫的意思是，在时空维度内，时间与空间通常具有均匀的关系。某一空间可以被以粒子或波的形式运动的能量覆盖，在一定时间内以特定速度运动，这种关系在时空宇宙中几乎随处可见，并且是整齐且可预测的。然而，在超越时空的中间维度中，能量被限制为振荡运动的方式不再像我们物理宇宙中那样均匀。因而可能遇到各种不同的扭曲与不一致，因而我们在此维度中对于时间与空间关系的固定认知不再适用。

更为重要的是，当当前时空维度被超越时，通向过去和未来的通道也随之打开。

### 22. Special Status, Out-of-Body Experience.

Although human consciousness can, with enoughpractice,movebeyond thedimension of time-space and interface with other energy systems in other dimensions, the entire process is appreciably enhanced if that consciousness can be detached in large measure from the physical body before such interface is attempted. Once an individual becomes proficient in the technique of out-of-body movement and then reaches the point where he is able to break out of time-space while out of his body, he gains the advantage of "clicking out" part of his enhanced consciousness while starting from a base located much closer to the dimensions with which he wishes to communicate.
In other words, since he is starting from a point much "higher up", to use an analogy from the time-space context, that part of his consciousness involved in "clicking out" will have that much more time to interact in dimensions beyond time-space because less time is required to traverse the intervening layers. Moreover, once the individual i s able t o project his consciousness beyond time-space, that consciousness would logically tend to entrain its frequency output with the new energy environment to which it is exposed, therein greatly enhancing the extent to which the individual's altered consciousness may be further modified to achieve a much heightened point of focus and a much refined oscillating pattern. As a result, a self-reinforcing process should ensue whereby the farther consciousness in the out-of-body state can be projected beyond the time-space dimension, the more its level of energy output would be enhanced, thus promoting the potential for still further travel. The tentative conclusion to be drawn is that the out-of-body state may be regarded as an extremely effective way of accelerating the process of enhancing consciousness and of interfacing with dimensions beyond time-space. If the practitioner of the Gateway technique has a choice of concentrating on achieving and exploiting the out-of-body experience as opposed to concentrating his full efforts on expanding his consciousness exclusively from a physical base, the former would appear to promise much faster and more impressive successes than does the latter.

	22.	特殊状态：体外体验

尽管人类的意识通过足够的练习可以超越时空维度并与其他维度中的能量系统互动，但若在此过程中意识能够在很大程度上脱离物理身体，那么整个过程的效果会显著增强。一旦个体熟练掌握了体外移动的技巧，进而在体外状态下超越时空维度，他就能够获得一种优势：从更接近目标维度的基点开始“退出”部分增强的意识。

换句话说，由于他从一个更“高”的位置出发（以时空概念作类比），他的意识中参与“退出”的部分将拥有更多时间在超越时空的维度中互动，因为跨越中间层的时间减少。此外，一旦个体能够将其意识投射到超越时空的领域，该意识可能会逐渐同步到新的能量环境的频率上，由此极大地增强了个体调整意识的能力，使其聚焦更加高度集中，振荡模式也更为精细。

结果是，一个自我增强的过程将随之产生：体外状态中的意识投射越远，其能量输出水平就会越高，进而增加进一步旅行的潜力。由此可以得出一个初步结论，即体外状态可以被视为加速意识增强和与超越时空的维度进行连接的极其有效的方法。如果Gateway技术的实践者可以选择专注于实现并利用体外体验，而不是完全依靠物理基础扩展意识，前者似乎会带来更快速和更显著的成功。

### 23. Absolute in Perspective.

It may be helpful at this point to pause and recap the major aspects of our intellectual journey from time-space to the realm of the Absolute.
We have spoken at some length concerning the incredibly complex hologram which is created by the intersection of energy patterns generated by the totality of all dimensions of the universe, time-space included. We have noted thatour minds constitute energy fields which interact with various aspects of this hologram to deduce information which is ultimately processed through the left hemisphere of our brains to reduce it to a form that we employ for the process we call thinking. We have implied that this hologram is the finite embodiment in active, energy form of the infinite consciousness of the Absolute. It is the title we assigned to that vast pool of energy in a state of perfect rest over which the physical universe is layered, and from whence it comes.
Incidentally, to describe this, Bentov u s e s the analogy of a very deep sea, comparing the s t i l l depths of the sea to the dimension of the Absolute while assigning the storm-tossed waves above to represent the physical universe with which we are familiar. The slightly agitated currents of the sea to be found in between the turbulent surface and the totally still depths represent energy in the process of either going into rest(i.e. approaching: infinity) or coming out of rest.

	23.	绝对视角

在此，不妨停下来回顾一下我们从时空领域到“绝对”领域的主要概念旅程。我们已经详细讨论了这个极为复杂的全息图，它是由宇宙中所有维度（包括时空）生成的能量模式交织而成的。我们的意识场构成了一个能量场，与全息图的各个方面相互作用，从中推导出信息，最终经过我们左脑处理，转化为我们用于思考的形式。我们也暗示这种全息图是“绝对”无限意识在有形能量形式中的有限体现。这个“绝对”是我们赋予的名称，用于描述这个完全静止的广袤能量池，它位于物理宇宙之下，并且是其来源。

值得一提的是，Bentov用深海来比喻这一现象，将深海的宁静深处比作“绝对”的维度，而将我们熟悉的波涛汹涌的海面比作物理宇宙。介于动荡的海面和完全静止的海底之间的稍微扰动的海流，代表了处于休息状态或逐渐进入静止状态的能量（即接近“无限”）。

### 24. From Big Bang to Torus.

Working from the widely accepted "Big Bang" theory Bentov presentsa conceptual model to depict the process of time-space evolution the relative position of the universal hologram. That hologram is often called a "Torus" because it is thought to have the overall shape of an immense, self-contained spiral. Basing his thesis on recent studies concerning the distribution of quasars(quasi-stellar objects), and operating on the premise that in the universe smaller processes tend to be mirror images of larger ones(i.e. the pattern of electrons around the nucleus of an atom mirrors the way planets orbit their suns, and so on) Bentov postulates the following scenario.
Taking his cue from the observed capability of quasars to eject enormously concentrated beams of matter from their i n t e r i o r s in a controlled, non-concentric version of the "Big-bang" he envisages a similar process occurring in the generation of the universe(see Exhibit 4, next page). Noting that those galaxies located to the north of our own galaxy are moving away faster than those located to the south, and that those to the east and west are demonstrably more distant, Bentov regards this as substantive evidence that the jet of matter which expanded into our universe has turned back upon itself, eventually forming an ovoid or egg shape. He sees "matter" in our universe entering the ovoid pattern following ejection from a nucleus composed of extremely compressed energy through a "white hole." At the end of its trip to the far end of the ovoid, he sees it departing via a "black hole". In such a model, time is observed to be a measure of the change which occurs as energy evolves into new, more complex forms as it progresses along the distance from the white hole side of the nucleus, around the shell of this "cosmic egg" until it enters the black hole. In other words, as energy--expelled from infinity and confined within limits by the conscious of the Absolute--achieves form and motion following ejection from the white hole at the top of the egg, time begins as a measure o f the cadence of this evolutionary movement as "reality" goes around the shell of the egg on its journey to the black hole at the far end.

	24.	从大爆炸到环形体

基于广泛接受的“大爆炸”理论，Bentov提出了一个概念模型，用来描绘时空演化过程及全息图的相对位置。这个全息图常被称为“环形体（Torus）”，因为它被认为呈现为一个庞大而自成一体的螺旋形。Bentov的论点基于对类星体（准星体）分布的最新研究，同时基于一种假设，即宇宙中的较小过程往往是较大过程的镜像（例如，原子核周围电子的运动方式与行星围绕恒星的运动方式相似）。

在这种背景下，Bentov设想了以下情景。他从类星体能够从内部喷射出极为集中的物质束这一观察出发，认为宇宙生成过程中发生了类似的现象。他注意到，在我们银河系以北的星系正以比以南星系更快的速度远离我们，而东西两侧的星系距离明显更远。这种现象被他视为有力证据，表明从核中喷射出来扩展为我们宇宙的物质喷流最终会向自身回归，逐渐形成一个卵形或蛋形。

在这个模型中，“物质”在被从由极度压缩能量组成的核中通过“白洞”喷射出来后，进入卵形的路径。在路径的另一端，他设想物质会通过“黑洞”离开。在这个模型中，时间被视为能量沿着卵形轨迹从白洞出发向黑洞前进并逐渐演化为新的、更复杂形式的一个变化的度量。换句话说，能量从无限中喷射出来，由“绝对”意识限定范围并赋予形态和运动后，从“宇宙蛋”顶部的白洞喷出，时间随之开始，作为这种进化运动的节奏度量，随着“现实”沿着蛋的外壳向黑洞方向前行。

### 25. Our Place in Time.

The observed distribution of galaxies suggests that our particular universe is located near the top of the egg at the point where matter begins to fall back on itself , thus explaining the reason why the galaxies t o the north are seen to be moving away more rapidly as they are caught up in the downturn of the stream of matter towards the far end of the cosmic egg(see Exhibit 5, next page). Layered over this cosmic egg is the Absolute which sustains the radiating nucleus from which the original j e t of matter issued forth.
As the stream of matter moves around the ovoid towards its destination at the black hole where it will be reabsorbed into the radiating nucleus and then the Absolute, it generates the interference pattern within the cosmic egg which constitutes the universal hologram or Torus. Since the Torus is being simultaneously generated by matter in allthevarious phases of "time", it reflects the development of the universe in the past, present and future(as it would be seen from our particular perspective in one phase of
time).
By reflecting on this model, it becomes possible to "see" how human consciousness brought to a sufficiently altered(focused) state could obtain information concerning the past, present an future since they all exist in the universal hologram simultaneously(In the case of the future because all of the consequences of the past and present can be seen coming together in the hologram such that the future can be predicted or "seen" with total accuracy). Moreover, it is possible to see how the implosion of energy patterns would cross and recross to create an incredibly complex four dimensional hologram or Torus, in spiral shape in reflection of the multi-dimensional developing pattern of evolution. All of the movements of the energies which comprise the universe leave their mark and hence tell their story throughout time.

	25.	我们在时间中的位置

观测到的星系分布表明，我们的宇宙位于“宇宙蛋”顶部附近，也就是物质开始回落自身的位置。这可以解释为什么北边的星系似乎以更快的速度远离我们，因为它们被卷入物质流向“宇宙蛋”远端的下降过程中（参见后页的图示5）。这个“宇宙蛋”层叠在绝对之上，而绝对支持着最初物质喷流的辐射核心。当物质流在卵形结构中向黑洞的终点前进时，它会产生一种干涉图案，构成了宇宙的全息图或“环形体”（Torus）。

由于这个环形体是由处于不同“时间”阶段的物质同时生成的，它展现了宇宙在过去、现在和未来的发展（从我们的时间视角来看）。通过反思这个模型，我们可以理解人类的意识在被带到足够改变（聚焦）状态时如何能够获得有关过去、现在和未来的信息，因为这些都在宇宙的全息图中同时存在（关于未来，因为过去和现在的所有结果都在全息图中汇集在一起，因此未来可以被完全精确地预测或“看到”）。

此外，可以看出能量模式的“内爆”会相互交叉，形成一个极其复杂的四维全息图或螺旋形环形体，反映了进化的多维发展模式。构成宇宙的所有能量运动都会留下痕迹，从而在时间中讲述其自身的故事。

### 26. Quality of Consciousness.

We noted earlier that the out-of-body state involves projection of a major portion of the energy pattern that represents human consciousness so that it may move either freely throughout the terrestrial sphere for purposes of information aquisition or into other dimensions outside of time-space, perhaps to interact with other forms of consciousness within the universe. Consciousness is the organizing and sustaining principle that provides the impetus and guidance t o bring and keep energy in motion within a given s e t of parameters so that a specific reality will result. When consciousness reaches state of sophistication in which it can perceive itself (its own hologram) it reaches the point of selfcognition.
Human beings have this form of elevated consciousness as does the Absolute but in case of the latter, it is a function of energy and its associated quality of consciousness in infinity(omniscience and omnipotence in perceptual unity). When energy returns to a state of total rest within the Absolute, it returns to the continuum of consciousness in the pool of limitless, timeless perception that resides there. Thus, the more complex an energy system in the "material" state, the more consciousness it possesses to maintain its reality. Our consciousness, therefore, is that differentiated aspect of the universal consciousness which resides within the Absolute.
It accounts for the organization of the energy patterns which constitute our physical body but is distinctly separate from and superior to it.
Since consciousness exists quite apart from and outside of reality, beyond the bounds of time-space, it, like the Absolute, has neither beginning nor end. Reality has both a beginning and an end because it is bounded within time-space, but the fundamental quantum of energy and its associated consciousness is eternal. When reality ends, its constituent energy simply returns to infinity in the Absolute.

	26.	意识的质量

我们之前提到，出体状态涉及将代表人类意识的主要能量模式投射出来，使其能够自由地在地球范围内移动以获取信息，或进入超越时间-空间的其他维度，与宇宙中的其他意识形式互动。意识是组织和维持能量运动的原则，它提供了推动和引导作用，以在特定参数内保持能量的运动，从而创造出具体的现实。当意识达到能够感知自身（即自我全息图）的复杂程度时，就达到了自我认知的阶段。人类和绝对（Absolute）都具备这种高级形式的意识。然而，对于绝对而言，这种意识是一种无限状态中的能量表现（在感知的统一中具备全知全能）。

当能量在绝对中回归到完全静止的状态时，它重新融入了无限、永恒的意识连续体中。由此可见，物质状态下的能量系统越复杂，所需的意识也就越强，以维持其现实。因此，我们的意识是绝对中普遍意识的一个分化部分。它组织了构成我们物质身体的能量模式，但却与身体本身截然不同，并且优越于它。

由于意识存在于现实之外、超越了时间-空间的界限，因此它与绝对一样，没有起始也没有终结。现实则有开始和结束，因为它被时间-空间所限制，但构成现实的基本能量量子及其相关的意识是永恒的。当现实终结时，构成它的能量仅仅回归到绝对的无限之中。

### 27. Consciousness in Perspective.

Having ascertained that human consciousness i s able to separatefromphysicalreality and interact with other intelligences in other dimensions within the universe, and that it is both eternal and destined for ultimate return to the Absolute we are faced with the question: "So what happens then?"
Since memory is a function of consciousness and therefore enjoys the same eternal character as the consciousness which accounts for its existence it must be admitted that when consciousness returns to the Absolute it brings with it all the memories it has accumulated through experience in reality. The return of consciousness to the Absolute does not imply an extinction of the separate entity which the consciousness organized and sustained in reality. Rather, it suggests a differentiated consciousness which merges with and participates in the universal consciousness and infinity of the Absolute without losing the separate identity and accumulated self-knowledge which its memories confer upon it. What it does lose i s the capability for generation of independent thought holograms, since that can be done only by energy in motion. In other words, it retains the power to perceive but loses the power of will or choice. In exchange, however, t h i s consciousness participates in the all-knowing infinite continuum of consciousness which is a characteristic of energy in the ever present. Consequently, it is accurate to observe that when a person experiences the out-of- body state he is, in fact, projecting that eternal spark of consciousness and memory which constitutes the ultimate source of his identity to l e t it play in and learn from dimensions both inside and outside the time-space world in which his physical component currently enjoys a short period of reality.

	27.	意识的视角

既然我们已经确定人类意识能够从物理现实中分离出来，与宇宙中的其他维度和智慧相互作用，并且意识是永恒的，最终会回归绝对（Absolute），那么问题来了：“然后会发生什么呢？”因为记忆是意识的功能，且与意识一样享有同样的永恒特性，所以在意识回归到绝对时，它会带回在现实中积累的所有记忆。

意识回归绝对并不意味着它所组织和维持的个体实体的消亡。相反，这表明一种分化的意识融入并参与到绝对的普遍意识和无限之中，同时保留其独立的身份和记忆赋予的自我认知。然而，它会失去产生独立思想全息图的能力，因为这只有在能量运动中才能实现。换句话说，它保留了感知的能力，但失去了意志或选择的能力。作为交换，这种意识参与到一个无所不知的、永恒的意识连续体中，这是处于永恒中的能量的特征。

因此，可以说，当一个人经历出体状态时，实际上是将其永恒的意识和记忆投射出来，让它在时间-空间维度内外探索、学习。这种意识火花不仅是其身份的最终来源，也为其短暂的物理生命赋予了体验和成长的机会。

### 28. Gateway Method.

Having put the Gateway Experience in context by postulating a structural outline of how and why it seems to work, and having shown what it i s designed to achieve, the time has come to examine the specific techniques which comprise the Gateway training process. These techniques are designed to enable the user of the Gateway tapes to manipulate the high energy states which can:be achieved if the user continues to work with the tapes over a period of time. The amount of time required to reach advanced energy states and to fully exploit the techniques varies with the individual.
The sensitivity of his nervous system, his general state of mind, and the extent to which he may have previously developed facility in related techniques such as transcendental meditation are a l l pertinent factors affecting the speed at which he may expect to progress. The Gateway process begins by teaching the individual participant to isolate extraneous concerns in a visualization device called an "energy conversion box."' Next, the participant is introduced to a method of encouraging his mind and body to strive to achieve a state of resonance through utterance of a single tone, a monotonous, protracted humming sound that sets up a feeling of vibration particularly in the head.
He engages in this "resonate tuning" as it is called by humming along with a chorus of such sounds that are contained on the Gateway tape. Following this, the participant is exposed to the Gateway affirmation, and is encouraged to repeat it to himself as he hears it repeated on the tape. This affirmation is a statement to the effect that the individual realizes that he is more than merely a physical body and that he deeply desires to expand his consciousness.

	28.	通关法（Gateway Method）

在对通关体验（Gateway Experience）进行结构性概述，并假设其工作机制及目标之后，我们可以进一步探讨其具体的训练方法。这些方法旨在帮助使用通关音频的人逐步达到和操控高能量状态。若持续使用音频一段时间，用户可以实现这种状态，达到不同程度的自我探索和意识扩展。不过，达到高阶能量状态和充分利用这些技术所需的时间因人而异，这取决于用户的神经系统敏感性、心理状态，以及先前是否在其他相关技术上有过基础，比如超觉静思冥想等。

通关过程首先引导参与者使用一种叫做“能量转换盒”的可视化工具来隔离外部干扰因素。接着，参与者通过发出单音（持续且单调的哼声）来使身心进入共振状态，这一过程被称为“共振调谐”。在这种状态下，尤其在头部，会产生一种振动的感觉，用户会随着音频中的一组哼唱声一起共鸣。之后，参与者会接触到通关宣言，并被鼓励在听到音频中的重复宣言时同步重复。这一宣言的核心内容在于让参与者意识到自我不只是一个物理身体，同时激发对意识扩展的强烈渴望。

### 29. Hemi-SyncIntroduced.

After that, he is exposed for the first time to the Hemi-Sync sound frequencies, and is encouraged to focus on and develop a perception of and appreciation for those feelings which accompany the synchronization of brainwaves that results. Next comes the technique of progressive and systematic physical relaxation while the Hemi-Sync frequencies are expanded to include additional forms of "pink and white" noise designed to put the physical body at the virtual threshhold of sleep as well as to calm the left hemisphere of the mind while raising the right hemisphere to a state of heightened attentiveness. Once all of this is achieved, the participant is invited to envisage creation of an "energy balloon" comprised of an energy flow beginning at the center of the top of the head and extending down in all directions to the feet. The energy involved in this flow then proceeds up through the body and back out into the balloon pattern again.
The "energy balloon", which sets up a pattern very reminiscent of the cosmic egg discussed earlier, not only enhances bodily energy flow and encourages early achievement of a suitable resonant state but it is also designed to provide protection against conscious entities possessing lower energy levels which the participant might encounter i n the event that he achieves an out-of-body, state.
It serves a precautionary purpose in the unlikely event that the participant's first out-of-body experience involves direct projection outside the terrestrial sphere.

	29.	引入同步脑半球技术（Hemi-Sync Introduced）

接下来，参与者首次接触到同步脑半球（Hemi-Sync）声音频率，并被鼓励专注于这种频率带来的感觉，欣赏同步脑波所带来的效果。在此基础上，他们将学习逐步的系统性身体放松技巧，同时同步脑半球的频率被扩展，加入了“粉噪声”和“白噪声”等成分。这些噪声帮助参与者将身体置于接近睡眠的边缘，平静左脑活动的同时使右脑达到高度的专注状态。

完成上述步骤后，参与者被引导构建一个“能量气泡”。这个气泡由能量流组成，从头顶中心开始，向下延展至脚底，再从脚底向上回流至头顶，形成一个完整的气泡循环。这个“能量气泡”不仅促进身体的能量流动，帮助早期达到合适的共振状态，同时也具有保护作用，防止在进入离体状态时可能接触到的低能量意识体。如果参与者的第一次离体体验包括投射到地球之外的空间，这一能量气泡还能提供额外的预防性保护。

### 30. Advanced Techniques.

Having reached Focus 10, the participant is now ready to endeavort o achievea state of sufficiently expanded awareness to begin actually interacting with dimensions beyond those associated with his experience of physical reality.
This state is called Focus 12 and involves conscious efforts on his part while additional forms of "pink and white noise" enter the sound stream being directed into his ears from the Gateway tape. Once the participant has achieved this state of greatly expanded awareness, he is ready to begin employing a series of specific techniques or "tools" as the Monroe Institute characterizes them which enable him to manipulate his newly found expanded awareness to obtain practical, useful feedback of value for promoting self-discovery and personal growth. The specific techniques involved are described individually below.

	30.	高级技巧

当参与者达到“专注10”（Focus 10）状态时，他们已准备好努力进入一个足够扩展的意识状态，真正开始与超越物理现实的维度进行互动。这个新的意识状态被称为“专注12”（Focus 12），需要参与者在有意识地努力的同时，接受来自“Gateway”音带中新增的“粉噪声”和“白噪声”频率的引导。当参与者进入这个极度扩展的意识状态后，他们便可以开始使用一系列特定的技巧或“工具”——正如门罗研究所所描述的那样——以操控这种新的扩展意识，从而获得促进自我发现和个人成长的实际反馈和有益信息。

以下章节将详细描述这些具体的技巧。

    A. Problem Solving. This technique involves identifying fundamental problems which theindividualwishes to see solved, filling his expanded awareness with his perception of these problems and then projecting them out into the universe. In this way, the individual enlists the assistance of what Monroe Institute calls his "higher self", in other words his expanded consciousness, to interact with the universal hologram to obtain the information required to solve the problem. This approach may be used to solve personal difficulties, technical problems in the realm of physics, mathmatics, etc., practical administrative problems, and so on. Responses to the problem solving technique may be received almost immediately, but often they come based on developing intuition over the next two to three days. Frequently the response comes in the form of a sudden, holistic perception in which the individual suddenly finds that he simply knows the answer in all of its ramifications and completely in context, sometimes without even being able to put his newly found perception into words, at least initially. In some cases, the response may even arrive in the form of visual symbols which the individual will"see" with his mind while he is in the Focus 12 state and which he will have to interpret after he returns to normal consciousness.

A. 问题解决

该技巧涉及识别个体希望解决的根本问题，将这些问题带入扩展的意识中，再将其投射到宇宙之中。通过这种方式，个体寻求门罗研究所所谓的“更高自我”的帮助，也就是其扩展的意识，来与宇宙全息图进行互动，从而获得解决问题所需的信息。这种方法可以用于解决个人困难、物理和数学领域的技术问题、实际的管理难题等。

对问题解决技巧的回应可能会立即产生，但通常会在接下来的两到三天内逐渐显现，表现为一种直觉上的发展。常见的回应形式是一种突然的、整体的感知，个体会突然发现自己完全了解了答案的各个方面，并且置于适当的情境中。有时，个体可能无法立即用语言表达新获得的洞见。在某些情况下，回应甚至会以视觉符号的形式出现，个体在专注12（Focus 12）状态下用心灵“看到”这些符号，需在恢复正常意识后进行解释。

    B. Patterning. This technique involves use of the consciousness to achieve desired objectives i n the physical, emotional, or intellectual sphere. it involves concentration on the desired objective while in a Focus 12 state, extension of the individual's perception of that objective into the whole expanded consciousness, and its projection into the universe with the intention that the desired objective is already a matter of established achievement which is destined to be realized within the time frame specified. This particular methodology is based on the belief that the thought patterns generated by our consciousness in a state of expanded awareness create holograms which represent the situation we desire to bring about and, in so doing, establish the basis for actual realization of that goal. Once the thought-generated hologram of the sought after objective is established in the universe it becomes an aspect of reality which interacts with the universal hologram to bring about the desired objective which might not, under other circumstances, ever occur. In other words, the technique of patterning recognizes the fact that since consciousness is the source of all reality, our thoughts have the power to influence the development of reality in time-space as it applies to us if those thoughts can be projected with adequate intensity. However, the more complicated the objective soughtand the more radically it departs from our current reality, the more time the universal hologram will need to reorient our reality sphere to accomodate our desires. Monroe trainers caution against attempting to force the pace of this process because the individual could succeed in dislocating his existing reality with drastic consequences.

B. 模式化

该技巧利用意识在物质、情感或智力层面实现预期目标。它涉及在专注12（Focus 12）状态下集中注意力于预期目标，将个体对目标的感知扩展到整个意识中，再将其投射到宇宙中，意图将目标视为既定成就，且会在指定的时间框架内实现。这一方法基于这样的信念：扩展意识状态下产生的思想模式会创造全息图，代表我们希望实现的情况，从而为实现这一目标奠定基础。

一旦思想生成的目标全息图在宇宙中建立，它便成为现实的一个方面，与宇宙全息图互动，促成该目标的实现，即便在其他情况下该目标可能永远无法实现。换句话说，模式化技巧基于这样的认知：既然意识是所有现实的源头，那么如果我们的思想能够以足够的强度被投射，它们就有能力影响我们所在时间-空间中的现实发展。然而，目标越复杂、越偏离当前现实，宇宙全息图就需要更多时间来重新定位我们的现实领域以满足我们的愿望。门罗训练者警告不要试图加速这一过程，因为这样可能导致现有现实的错位，带来严重后果。

    c. Color Breathing. The next technique is called color breathing and is designed to use the expanded awareness and highly focused attentiveness associated withthe Focus 12 state to imagine various colors in a particularly intense and vivid manner so as to use them to resonate with and in turn to activate the body's own energies. Fundamentally, in terms of practical application it i s a healing technique which is designed to restore the body and to enhance its physical capabilities by balancing, revitalizing and retuning bodily energy flows. It is predicated on the principle that the body's electromagnetic field is capable of altering its resonance pattern so as to entrain energy from the earth's electrostatic field for its own use. The various colors envisaged in the imagination as part of the technique cue the mind as to which frequencies and what specific amplitudes are desired in connection with this entrainment and the subsequent alterations in bodily energy flow patterns. That color has the capacity to affect the human mind is well known, and the affectuality of color in certain kinds of healing is a demonstrable fact. For example, application of an intense blue light to an area of physical tumescence leads to relatively rapid and easily observable reduction in the swelling while red, and to a lesser extent, yellow have quite the opposite effect. However, in the Hemi-Sync application of the technique external light sources are not involved but, rather, the mind is the sole agent of the healing and revitalization.

C. 色彩呼吸

色彩呼吸技巧利用了在专注12（Focus 12）状态下获得的扩展意识和高度集中的注意力，以特别强烈和生动的方式想象各种颜色，从而通过这些颜色与身体的能量共振，并进一步激活身体的自身能量。这一技巧的主要应用是作为一种治疗方法，旨在通过平衡、恢复和调节身体能量流来促进身体的复原和增强其生理能力。

此方法基于这样的原理：人体的电磁场能够改变其共振模式，以便从地球的静电场中获取能量供自身使用。在想象中构建的各种颜色引导心灵，使之捕捉到共振所需的特定频率和幅度，并据此调整身体的能量流模式。颜色对人类心灵的影响已众所周知，且在特定的治疗中其疗效也得到了证明。例如，强烈的蓝光应用于肿胀区域可以快速且显著地减少肿胀，而红色和黄色则具有相反的效果。然而，在门罗研究所的Hemi-Sync色彩呼吸技巧中，并不涉及外部光源，治疗和恢复仅通过心灵的力量完成。

    D. Energy Bar Tool. Magic wands and enchanted sceptors have been part of the folklore andoccult practices of many cultures. The scepters, staffs and maces carried by monarchs and high priests alike occur with such frequency in the history of bygone eras as to suggest that at the very least these items are aspects of some type of archtypical symbol which the human mind seems to appreciate, perhaps quite subliminally. In any case, the energy bar tool technique involves envisaging a small, intensely pulsating dot of light which the participant charges in his imagination with enormous energy until it is virtually pulsating. The participant then extrudes the dot into the shape of a sparkling, vibrating cylinder of energy which he then uses to channel force from the universe to selected parts of his body for purposes of healing and revitalization.

D. 能量棒工具

在许多文化的传说和神秘实践中，魔杖和附魔权杖扮演着重要角色。君主和高阶祭司手持的权杖、法杖、狼牙棒等频繁出现在历史记录中，几乎成为一种原型符号，暗示着这些物品在人类潜意识中具有某种重要象征意义。能量棒工具技术则通过想象并集中意念，构建一个小而强烈的脉动光点。然后，参与者在心中为这个光点充满巨大能量，直到它显现出强烈的脉动效果。

接着，参与者将光点拉伸成一个闪耀、振动的能量圆柱，并利用它将宇宙的能量引导至身体的特定部位，以达到自我疗愈和恢复的目的。这种能量棒成为身体能量的通道，帮助使用者增强身体活力并加速复原过程。

    E. Remote Viewing. In addition, the energy bar tool is used as a portal for initiating a follow-ontechnique called "remote viewing." In this context, the participant turns his bar of energy into a whirling vortex through which he sends his imagination in search of new and illuminating insights. The apparent purpose of the symbolism involved in the vortex seems to be to cue the subconscious and convey to it instructions as to what the participant wishes to do but in terms of nonverbal symbols which the right hemisphere of the mind is capable of understanding.

E. 远程观视

此外，能量棒工具还可作为启动后续技术“远程观视”的入口。在这一情境中，参与者将其能量棒转化为一个旋转的漩涡，通过该漩涡引导自己的想象力去探索新的、启发性的见解。在远程观视中，这种漩涡的象征作用在于为潜意识提供提示，向其传达参与者的意图，但这种传达通过非语言的符号完成，使得右脑可以理解并执行这些指令。

通过这种方式，参与者能够在不受物理空间限制的情况下“看到”远处的场景或获取信息，进一步扩展自我意识的边界。这一过程旨在利用右脑的非线性思维，提升自我洞察力和对未知的认知能力。

    F. Living Body Map: This technique provides amplification for application of the energy bar tool as a means of healing specific areas or systems of the human body. The configuration of the participant's body is imagined and then the various major systems such as the nervous and circulatory systems are envisaged in appropriate colors within the confines of the outline being held in the imagination. The energy bar tool is then applied to energizing, balancing and healing in whatever manner the participant desires. In the process, the participant visualizes various streams of colored energy flowing out of the tool into the organ system or area upon which the revitalizing or healing application is being made. Since colors are the result of differing wavelengths of light, which is to say energy at various frequencies, this technique operates on the assumption that as the human body is composed o f energy it can be vitalized and healed through the additive application of additional energy provided that the energy is applied in the appropriate form.

F. 活体身体图

这一技术通过运用能量棒工具放大特定身体区域或系统的疗愈效果。参与者首先在想象中勾勒出身体的轮廓，并设想诸如神经系统、循环系统等主要系统，以适当的颜色呈现在想象的轮廓内。然后，能量棒工具被用于赋能、平衡和疗愈，以满足参与者的需求。

在此过程中，参与者可想象各种颜色的能量流从工具中流出，流向正在进行活力注入或疗愈的器官系统或区域。由于颜色源自不同波长的光（即以不同频率振动的能量），该技术基于这样的假设：作为能量构成的身体，通过以适当形式添加额外能量，可以被激活和疗愈。

    G. Focus 15: Travel into the Past. All of the preceding techniques are conducteda tthel e v e lo f expanded awareness known as Focus 12. However, the technique of time travel into the past involves further expansion of consciousness through the inclusion of additional levels of sound on the Hemi-Sync tapes. Some of the sound is probably merely an intensification of the basic Hemi-Sync frequencies, being designed to further modify brainwave frequency and amplitude. Other aspects of the added sound patterns appear to be designed to provide subtle, almost subliminal suggestions to the mind as to what is desired by way of further expanded consciousness so as to support the verbal suggestions and instructions also contained on the tape. Even the instructions are highly symbolic, with time being visualized as a huge wheel in the universe with various spokes each of which gives access to a different part of the participant's past. Focus 15 is a very advanced state and is extremely difficult to achieve. Probably less than five percent of all participants in any given Gateway Experience actually fully achieve the Focus 15 state during the course of the approximately seven days of training. Nonetheless, Monroe Institute trainers affirm that with enough practice, eventually Focus 15 can be achieved. They also state that not only the individual's past history is available for examination by one who has achieved Focus 15 but other aspects of the past with which the individual himself has had no connection may also be accessed.

G. Focus 15：穿越过去

前述的所有技术均在被称为 Focus 12 的扩展意识层次上进行。然而，“穿越过去”的时间旅行技术则需要通过在 Hemi-Sync 音频中增加额外的音频层次来进一步扩展意识。一些声音可能仅仅是对基本 Hemi-Sync 频率的强化，用于进一步调整脑电波的频率和振幅。其他新增的声音模式则似乎意在给心智提供微妙、几乎潜意识的暗示，以支持录音中包含的言语指引与指示。

这些指示通常具有高度象征性，比如将时间设想为宇宙中的巨大轮盘，每一条轮辐都通向参与者过去的不同部分。Focus 15 是一个非常高级的意识状态，极难达成。在任何一次 Gateway 体验中，能够在大约七天的训练中完全实现 Focus 15 状态的参与者可能不到 5％。尽管如此，门罗研究所的培训师表示，通过足够的练习，最终可以达成 Focus 15。他们还指出，达成 Focus 15 状态后，参与者不仅可以查看自己的过往历史，还可能接触到与其本人无关的其他过去事件。

    H. Focus 21: The Future. The last and most advanced of all the Focus states associated with the Gateway training program involves movement outside of the boundaries of time-space as in Focus 15 but with attention to discovering the future rather than the past. The individual who has achieved this state has reached a truly advanced level. Except in unusual circumstances, it is probably not attainable except by those who have conditioned themselves through long application of meditation or by those who have practiced long and hard through use of the Hemi-Sync tapes for a period of months if not years.

H. Focus 21：预见未来

在所有与 Gateway 培训项目相关的 Focus 状态中，Focus 21 是最后也是最先进的一种。与 Focus 15 类似，Focus 21 同样需要超越时空的界限，但其目标是探索未来，而非过去。达成此状态的个体已达到极为先进的意识层次。除非在极为特殊的情况下，Focus 21 一般只能由那些通过长时间冥想锻炼自身的人，或通过数月甚至数年的 Hemi-Sync 录音练习后才有可能达到。

### 31. The Out-of-Body Movement.

This remarkable phenomenon has been saved for discussioni nd e t a i l u n t i l last because of the interest which it occasions and special circumstances involved in its attainment. Monroe Institute stresses that the Gateway program was not established solely for the purpose of enabling participants to obtain the out-of-body state nor does the program guarantee that most participants will succeed in doing it during the course of the training at the Institute. Only one tape out of the many which make up the Gateway Experience is devoted to the techniques involved in the out-of-body movement. Basically, these techniques are merely designed to make it easier for the individual to achieve the out-of-body state when his brainwave pattern and personal energy levels have reached a point that he is in apparent harmony with his surrounding electromagnetic environment such that he feels that he has reached the threshhold where separation is a possibility. To facilitate achieving the out-of-body state,Bob Monroe, the founder of Monroe Institute, is quoted in a recent magazine article as saying that in order to assist the participant the particular Hemi-Sync tape concerned with that technique employs Beta signals of "around 2877.3 CPS." (cycles p e r second). Since 30 to 40 CPS is considered to be the normal range for Beta brainwave signals(those associated with the wakeful state), it is apparent that the Monroe Institute is convinced that the same heightened state of brainwave frequency output which promotes altered states of consciousness is also an important consideration in assisting in achievement of out-of-body states. The actual techniques employed for separating from the body involve such simple maneuvers as rolling out, lifting out after the fashion of a telephone pole wherein the individual separates in a rigid, headfirst manner(such that he finds himself standing at attention at the foot of his physical body) and sliding out through either end of his body.

31. 出体运动

由于其引发的兴趣及其实现的特殊条件，出体现象被安排在此处详细讨论。门罗研究所强调，Gateway 项目并非专门为让参与者获得出体状态而设计，且项目不保证大多数参与者在研究所的培训过程中都能实现出体状态。整个 Gateway 体验所包含的众多录音中，只有一盘录音专门用于涉及出体技术。基本上，这些技术只是为了让个体更容易实现出体状态，条件是其脑电波模式和个人能量水平已经达到了显然与周围电磁环境相协调的状态，使他觉得自己已接近可以分离的临界点。

为便于出体状态的实现，门罗研究所的创始人鲍勃·门罗（Bob Monroe）在最近一篇杂志文章中提到，为帮助参与者实现出体状态，特定的 Hemi-Sync 录音在这项技术中使用了频率约为 2877.3 CPS（每秒周期）的 Beta 信号。考虑到 Beta 脑电波信号的正常范围为 30 到 40 CPS（与清醒状态相关的信号），显然门罗研究所认为这种促进改变意识状态的高频脑电波输出同样是辅助出体状态的重要因素。

用于从身体中分离的实际技术包括简单的动作，例如滚出、像电话杆一样头部先出并保持刚直地分离（个体分离后发现自己站在其物理身体的脚部）以及从身体的任一端滑出等方式。

### 32. Role of REM Sleep.

It is interesting to note that Bob Monroe informed the Gateway class that finished 7May 1983 that an ex-trainer of his operating in Charlottesville, Virginia found that he could guarantee out-of-body movements by bringing participants down into a rapia eye movement(REM) state of sleep and then use the Hemi-Sync tape technique.
This may well be a function of thefact that
most if not all people reputedly go into an out-of-body s t a t e during REM sleep.
REM sleep is the deepest possible level of ordinary sleep and involves complete disengagement of the body's motor cortex functions from the neck down and nearly complete suppression of consciousness in the left brain hemisphere.
The effect of this is to put the body in a state of complete stillness so far as the skeletal muscle structure is concerned, thereby further promoting the state of deep rest needed to eliminate the bifurcation echo. In addition, it leaves theright hemisphere of the brain free to respond to the instructions and suggestions contained on the Gateway tape. However, use of the Hemi-Sync tapes at this point may be less a factor in actually achieving the out-of-body state than it ' is a matter of focusing the brain enough so that a residual memory of having naturally achieved an out-of-body state is carried into the waking state. Indeed, it may even be postulated that some dreams associated with deep levels of sleep are in fact functions of the same kind of altered consciousness involved in interaction with the universe that plays a role in all of the Focus 12, 15 and 21states described above.
The difference between those states and the condition of the mind in REM sleep seems to be that the left hemisphere is almost totally disengaged in the latter experience such that memory of what was achieved in the altered states of consciousness cannot usually be retrieved by conscious desire because the left hemisphere has no knowledge of its existence or its location in the right hemisphere.
Admittedly, some people can be trained to remember their REM state dreams through intense conditioning in the waking state but even that may be more a function of establishing pathways in the right hemisphere which the left hemisphere can access following reentry into the wakeful state than it is an indication of any specific left hemisphere conscious involvement in the process during REM sleep.
In any event, the three apparent conditions required for voluntarily inducing an out-of-body s t a t e in most individuals seems to be: (1) achievement of a s t a t e of profound quiet in the body such that the bifurcation echo fades and resonance at approximately 7 Hertz is established, (2) synchronization of the two brain hemisphere wave patterns, and (3)
subsequent stimulation of the right hemisphere of the mind to attain a state of heightened alertness(which, of course, interferes with brain hemisphere synchronization but not until a sufficient level of enhanced frequency range has first been established to help achieve the out-of-body state).

32. 快速眼动睡眠（REM）的作用

值得注意的是，鲍勃·门罗曾向 1983 年 5 月 7 日结束的 Gateway 课程学员透露，一位曾在弗吉尼亚州夏洛茨维尔工作的前教练发现，他可以通过将参与者带入快速眼动（REM）睡眠状态，然后使用 Hemi-Sync 录音技术来保证出体运动的实现。这可能与大多数人（如果不是所有人）据称在 REM 睡眠中进入出体状态有关。REM 睡眠是普通睡眠中最深的阶段，涉及从颈部以下的身体运动皮层功能完全脱离，以及左脑半球意识几乎完全被压制。这一效果使得在骨骼肌结构方面身体完全静止，进一步促进深层休息状态的形成，以消除分叉回声。此外，这使得右脑半球可以自由响应 Gateway 录音中的指令和建议。然而，在此阶段使用 Hemi-Sync 录音的作用或许不是实际帮助实现出体状态，而是集中大脑以便将自然出体状态的残留记忆带入清醒状态。事实上，甚至可以推测，与深层睡眠相关的某些梦实际上是与宇宙互动的同类意识改变功能，与之前描述的 Focus 12、15 和 21 状态中发挥作用的意识变化类似。

REM 睡眠中的这种状态与在这些特定意识状态中的区别在于，在 REM 睡眠中左脑半球几乎完全脱离，因此通过有意识的意图通常无法检索出在改变的意识状态中所达到的体验，因为左脑对其不存在或其在右脑的位置没有认识。当然，一些人可以通过在清醒状态下的强烈训练来记住他们的 REM 睡眠梦，但这可能更多是通过在右脑中建立路径，使左脑在重新进入清醒状态后能够访问这些记忆，而非在 REM 睡眠过程中左脑的有意识参与。

总而言之，大多数人自愿引发出体状态似乎需要以下三个条件：

	1.	身体进入深度静止状态，以使分叉回声消失，并建立约 7 赫兹的共振；
	2.	双脑半球的波形模式同步；
	3.	右脑半球随后被刺激达到高度警觉的状态（当然，这会干扰脑半球同步，但通常在已建立足够的增强频率范围后才会干扰，以帮助实现出体状态）。

### 33. Information Collection Potential.

The information acquisition potential associated with theout-of-bodys t a t eseems to attract the most attention from the standpoint of developing practical applications for the Gateway technique. Unfortunately, although the out-of-body s t a t e can apparently be achieved by many people without excessive expenditure of time or effort, the purposes to which it can be put are currently limited by the fact that although individuals in that state may travel anywhere on an instantaneous basis in either the terrestrial or in other spheres, information distortion in the former context remains a major concern.
To date, according to one of the trainers at Monroe Institute, numerous experiments have been conducted involving persons moving from one coast to the other in the out-of-body state to read a series of ten computer generated numbers in a university laboratory. Although most have aquired enough of thedigits to make clear that their consciousness was present none have ever succeeded in getting all ten correct. This seems to be a function of the fact that physical reality in the present is not the only holographic influence which the individual may encounter in an out-of-body state. There are also energy patterns left by people or events occurring at the same physical site being viewed, but from the past rather than the present.
In addition, since thoughts are the product of energy patterns, and energy patterns are reality, it may also be possible that individuals encounter thought forms while in an out-of-body s t a t e which mingle with physical reality and are not easily differentiated. Finally, as Melissa Jager writes, there is another potential problem area in the sense that holograms can be viewed pseudoscopically, that is to say inside out or backwards just as well as they can be seen in proper perspective. Some of the distortions occurring may ultimately prove to be traceable to this cause because in the out-of-body state an individual may perceive the holographic energy patterns given off by people or things interacting in time-space reality in a somewhat distorted form.

33. 信息收集的潜力

出体状态的信息获取潜力似乎在开发 Gateway 技术的实际应用方面吸引了最多的关注。不幸的是，尽管许多人似乎能够在无需大量时间或精力的情况下实现出体状态，但目前其应用的目的仍受到限制。尽管在这种状态下，个体可以瞬间穿越地球或其他领域，但在当前物理现实中获取信息的准确性仍然存在重大问题。据门罗研究所的一位教练所述，迄今为止已进行的多次实验中，参与者在出体状态下从一端移动到另一端，在大学实验室中读取十个计算机生成的数字。虽然大多数人能够获得足够多的数字来表明他们的意识确实在场，但没有人能完全正确地获得所有十个数字。这似乎是由于个体在出体状态下不仅会遇到当前的物理现实的全息图影响，还会遇到过去人或事件在相同物理位置留下的能量模式。此外，由于思想是能量模式的产物，而能量模式即是现实，个体在出体状态中可能遇到与物理现实交织的思想形式，这些形式可能难以区分。

最后，正如梅丽莎·耶格（Melissa Jager）所指出的，另一个潜在问题是全息图可以以伪立体方式呈现，即内外或反向成像，就像可以以正确的透视方式观看一样。这可能是导致某些扭曲的原因，因为在出体状态下，个体可能会以某种扭曲的形式感知到人或事物在时空现实中交互产生的全息能量模式。

### 34. Belief System Considerations.

In 1967, Alexandra David-Neel and Llama Yongden wrote a bookentitledSecretOral Teachingsi nTibetanBuddhist Sects, from which the
following quote i s taken:
"The tangible world is movement, say the Masters, not a collection of moving objects, but movement itself.
There are no objects "in movement," it is the movement which constitutes the objects which appear to us: They are nothing but movement.
This movement is a continued and infinitely rapid succession of flashes of energy (in Tibetan "tsal" or "shoug"). All objects perceptible to our senses, all phenomena of whatever kind and whatever aspect they may assume, are constituted by a rapid succession of instantaneous events."
The classic description of the universal hologram is to be found in a Hindu sutra which says:
"In the heaven of Indra there is said to be a network of pearls so arranged that if you look at one you see all the others reflected in it."
I have cited this quotation because it shows that the concept of the universe which at least some physicists are now coming to accept is identical in its essential aspects with the one known to the learned elite in selected civilizations and cultures of high attainment in the ancient world.
The concept of the cosmic egg, for example, is well known to scholars familiar with the ancient writings of the eastern religions. Nor are the theories presented in this paper at variance with the essential tenets of the Judeo-Christian stream of thought. The concept of visible reality(i.e. the "created" world) as being an emanation of an omnipotent and omniscient divinity who is completely unknowable in his primary state of being.
The Absolute at rest in infinity is a concept straight out of Hebrew mystical philosophy. Even the Christian concept of the Trinity shines through the description of the Absolute as presented in t h i s paper. The description of energy totally at rest, in infinity fits the Christian metaphysical concept of the Father while the infinite self-consciousness resident in that energy providing the motive force of will to bring a portion of that energy into motion to create reality corresponds with the Son. This is so because in order to attain self-consciousness, the consciousness of the Absolute must project a hologram of itself and then perceive it. That hologram is a mirror image of the Absolute in infinity, still exists outside time and space, but is one step removed from the Absolute and is the actual agent of all creation(all reality). And, the eternal thought or concept of self which results from this self-consciousness serves the

34. 信仰体系的考量

1967年，亚历山德拉·大卫-尼尔和喇嘛永丹合著了《西藏佛教教派中的秘密口授教义》一书，其中提到：“师父们说，有形的世界是运动，不是一堆运动的物体，而是运动本身。没有‘在运动’的物体，运动构成了我们看到的物体：它们只是运动。这种运动是连续且无限快速的能量闪动（在藏语中称为‘tsal’或‘shoug’）的序列。我们感知到的所有物体、任何形式的现象，无论它们呈现什么样的面貌，都是瞬间事件快速连续的产物。”在印度教的经文中，对全息宇宙的经典描述是：“据说在因陀罗的天国中，有一张珍珠网络，每一颗珍珠都能反射出其余所有的珍珠。”引用这一段是为了说明，至少部分物理学家如今接受的宇宙概念在本质上与古代一些高成就文明和文化的学者所认知的概念相同。比如，宇宙卵的概念在熟悉东方宗教古代著作的学者中众所周知。

本文的理论也并未与犹太-基督教的基本思想相悖。例如，基督教的“可见现实”（即“被创造的世界”）被视为一位无所不能、无所不知、在其本质状态下完全不可知的神性之显现。静止于无限中的“绝对体”的概念正是源于希伯来神秘哲学。在本文的描述中，基督教的三位一体的概念也得以体现。能量在无限中完全静止的描述与基督教中“父”的形象相吻合，而那居住在这能量中、为创造现实而将部分能量赋予运动的无限自我意识之动力则对应于“子”。这是因为，要获得自我意识，绝对体的意识必须投射一个自身的全息图并感知它。该全息图是无限中的绝对体的镜像，存在于时间和空间之外，但与绝对体有一定的分离，并成为所有创造（即所有现实）的实际代理。而从这种自我意识中产生的永恒思想或自我概念则扮演着…

### 37. Motivational Aspect. It is a step by step procedure which involves repetitive practice of the techniques concerned, using each new insight as a means of penetrating farther during the next practice session.

But the rate of progress is so much faster with the Gateway approach than it is with transcendental meditation or other forms of mental self-discipline and its horizons seem t o be so much wider that the discipline needed to practice it would seem to be within the means of even the impatient, result oriented, skeptical pragmatist of our society. Unlike yoga and other forms of eastern mental discipline, Gateway does not require the infinite patience and total personal subservience to and faith in a system of discipline designed to absorb all the individual's energies over most of a lifetime. Rather, it will begin to produce at least minimal results within a relatively short time such that enough feedback is available to motivate and energize the individual to continue working with it.
Indeed, the speed with which an individual may expect to progress seems less a function of the number of hours spent practicing than it is a question of the speed with which he or she is able to use the insights gained to release anxieties and stresses within both the mind and the body. These points of energy blockage seem to provide the principal barriers to achieving the enhanced energy states and focus of mind needed for rapid progression. The more compulsive, the more "uptight" the individual may be at the outset the more barriers he or she will initially encounter to achieving a deep or immediate experience, but as the insights begin to come and the blockages begin to dissolve, the way ahead becomes increasingly clear and the value of Gateway moves from the status of a matter of intellectual assessment to one of personal experience.

37. 激励因素

Gateway训练是一种循序渐进的过程，通过反复练习相关技术，每次新收获的洞见都用来在下一次练习中进一步深入。相比于超觉冥想或其他形式的心理自律，Gateway方法的进展速度要快得多，而且其探索的视野也要广阔得多，因此即便是那些追求快速结果的、带有怀疑态度的现实主义者也能接受这项练习所需的自律。不同于瑜伽和其他东方的精神修炼，Gateway不需要无限的耐心，也不要求个人完全服从一个耗费一生心力的纪律体系。相反，它在相对较短的时间内就能带来至少一些微小的成效，从而产生足够的反馈，激励并促进个人继续进行练习。

事实上，一个人期望的进步速度似乎与其花费的练习时间多少无关，更取决于其能多快利用所获得的洞见来释放内在的焦虑和压力。这些能量阻塞点似乎是快速进步所需的高度集中和心智提升的主要障碍。刚开始时越焦虑、越“紧张”的人越有可能在最初的阶段遇到阻碍以致难以立即获得深刻体验，但当洞见逐渐增多，阻碍逐渐化解，前进的道路也愈发清晰。此时，Gateway的价值将从一种智力上的评估转变为一种切身的体验。

### 38. Conclusion.

There is a sound, rational basis in terms of physical science parameters for considering Gateway to be plausible in terms of its essential objectives.
Intuitional insights of not only personal but of a practical and professional nature would seem to be within bounds of reasonable expectations. However, a phased approach for entering the Gateway Experience in an accelerated mode would seem to be required if the time needed to reach advanced states of altered consciousness is to be brought within more manageable limits from the standpoint of establishing an organization-wide exploitation of Gateway's potential.
The most promising approach suggested in the foregoing study involves the following steps:
A. Begin by using the Gateway Hemi-Sync tapes to achieve enhanced brain focus and to induce hemisphere synchronization.
B. Then add strong REM sleep frequencies to induce left brain quiescence and deep physical relaxation.
C. Provide hypnotic suggestion designed to enable an individual to induce deep autohypnotic state at will.
D. Use autohypnotic suggestion to a t t a i n much enhanced focus of concentration and motivation in rapidly progressing through Focus 12 exercises.
E. Then repeat steps A and B following use of the autohypnotic suggestion that an out-of-body movement will occur and be remembered.
F. Repeat step E to achieve facility in gaining out-of-body state under conscious control. Alter hypnotic suggestion to stress ability to consciously control out-of-body movement and maintain it even after REM sleep state ends.
G. Approach Focus 15 and 21 objectives (escape from time-space and interact within new dimensions) from the out-of-body perspective.
H. Use multi-focus approach to solve problem of distortion in terrestrial information
gathering trips. This approach involves the use of three individuals in the out-of-body state, one viewing the target object here, in time-space, one viewing it at Focus 15 as it slips into the immediate past, and one viewing it a t Focus 21 as it slips from the immediate future. Debrief all three and compare data gathered from the three points of view. If care is taken to insure that the three all go out-of-body together, in the same environment, their consciousness energy systems should resonate in sympathetic oscillation. They can tune in to the same target on different planes(dimensions) with greater effectiveness.
I. Encourage pursuit of full self knowledge by all individuals involved in the foregoing experiments to enhance objectivity in out-of-body observation and thinking, and to remove personal energy blockages likely to retard rapid progress.
J. Be intellectually prepared to react to possible encounters with intelligent, non-corporal energy forms when time-space boundaries are exceeded.
K. Arrange to have groups of people in Focus 12 state unite their altered consciousness to build holographic patterns around sensitive areas to repulse possible unwanted out-of-body presences.
I. Encourage more advanced Gateway participants to build holographic patterns of successful attainment and rapid progress for advanced colleagues to assist them in progressing through the Gateway system.
If these experiments are carried through, it is to be hoped that we will truly find a gateway to Gateway and to the realm of practical application for the whole system of techniques which comprise it.

38. 结论

从物理科学的角度来看，Gateway项目在其基本目标上具备合理的、符合逻辑的依据。除了个人的直觉洞见，这些技术还可能带来实用性和专业性的发展，且是可以合理预期的。然而，为了在较短时间内达到更高层次的意识改变，实现组织层面对Gateway潜力的广泛利用，可能需要分阶段的加速进入策略。

该研究提出的最有希望的方法包括以下步骤：

A. 首先使用Gateway的Hemi-Sync磁带来增强大脑的专注力，诱导两半球同步。

B. 然后加入强烈的REM睡眠频率，令左脑安静并使身体深度放松。

C. 提供催眠暗示，使个体能够随意进入深层自我催眠状态。

D. 利用自我催眠暗示来提升专注和动力，从而迅速进行Focus 12的练习。

E. 然后在使用自我催眠暗示后重复步骤A和B，期待在体外移动（出体）的同时能够记住体验。

F. 继续重复步骤E，以便在意识控制下实现并掌握出体状态。修改催眠暗示，以加强个体在REM睡眠状态结束后仍然能控制出体的能力。

G. 从出体的角度开始探索Focus 15和21的目标（突破时空的限制并在新维度中互动）。

H. 使用多焦点法解决地面信息收集中的失真问题。此方法要求三名出体个体协同工作：一个观察当前时空的目标物，另一个在Focus 15中观察目标物的过去，一个在Focus 21中观察未来。对三人的数据进行汇总比较，以便获得不同维度的综合信息。若三人同时出体，并置于相同环境，其意识能量系统将产生共振，更有效地同步聚焦于同一目标。

I. 鼓励参与实验的人员追求全面的自我认识，以增强出体观察和思考的客观性，同时消除可能减缓进展的个人能量阻塞。

J. 为可能遇到的智能非物质能量形式做好思想准备，特别是当超越时空界限时。

K. 组织处于Focus 12状态的群体，以其改变的意识共同构建全息图模式，围绕敏感区域以排斥不必要的出体存在。

L. 鼓励更高级的Gateway参与者构建成功和快速进展的全息图，以帮助他们的同僚顺利进入更深层的Gateway系统。

若这些实验得以顺利推进，期望能够开启一扇通往Gateway的实际应用之门，从而将整个技术系统的潜力发挥到实用层面。
