# local run

To access a service running on a local host behind a carrier-grade NAT (CGNAT), especially on a mobile carrier's network, you have a few options. Since the direct public IP address is not available due to CGNAT, you'll need to use one of the following workarounds:

1. Use a VPS with a Public IP for Port Forwarding
   Set Up a VPS: Obtain a Virtual Private Server (VPS) with a public IP address.
   Create a Reverse SSH Tunnel:
   On your local host (the server running on port 3456), set up an SSH connection to the VPS.

   - [localhost.run](http://localhost.run/docs/)

   Use the following command on your local server:

   ```bash
   ssh -R 0.0.0.0:3456:localhost:3456 user@vps_public_ip
   ```

   You may need to add the -N flag to prevent the SSH command from running a shell command on the remote host:

   ```sh
   ssh -N -R 0.0.0.0:8080:localhost:3456 user@compute_engine_ip
   ```

   This command forwards all traffic on port 3456 of the VPS to port 3456 of your local server.
   Access the Service: You can now access the service on your local server by connecting to vps_public_ip:3456 from the internet.

   SSH Server Configuration on Compute Engine:
   Check the SSH server configuration on the Compute Engine to ensure it allows remote port forwarding:
   On the Compute Engine, open the SSH configuration file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```

   Look for the GatewayPorts setting. It should be set to yes:

   ```bash
   GatewayPorts yes
   ```

   If you modify this setting, restart the SSH service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart ssh
   ```

2. Set Up a VPN
   VPN Server on VPS: Set up a VPN server on a VPS with a public IP address.
   Connect Your Local Server to the VPN: Configure your local server to connect to the VPN. Once connected, it will be accessible via the VPN's network.
   Port Forwarding: Forward the necessary ports (like 3456) on the VPS to your local server via the VPN.

3. Use a Third-Party Tunneling Service
   Ngrok or [LocalTunnel](https://theboroer.github.io/localtunnel-www/): Use a service like Ngrok or LocalTunnel to create a secure tunnel from your local server to the internet.
   Install and Run:
   Install the tunneling service on your local server.
   Run a command like:

   ```bash
   ngrok tcp 3456
   ```

   Ngrok will provide you with a public URL that you can use to access your local service on port 3456.

4. Dynamic DNS with Port Knocking (Advanced)
   Dynamic DNS: Set up Dynamic DNS (DDNS) to map a domain name to your dynamic IP address.
   Port Knocking: Use port knocking to trigger a reverse SSH tunnel or some other mechanism to open the necessary ports and connect back to your internal server.

5. Request a Public IP from Your ISP
   Check with Your ISP: Some ISPs may offer a public IP address, even if you're behind CGNAT, usually for an additional fee.
   Port Forwarding: Once you have a public IP, you can set up port forwarding on your router to forward traffic from the internet to port 3456 on your local server.

6. Use Remote Desktop or Control Software
   Remote Access Software: Tools like TeamViewer, AnyDesk, or Chrome Remote Desktop allow you to control your local server remotely. While not direct access to port 3456, these tools enable you to manage your server from anywhere.

Summary:

The best approach depends on your specific needs, resources, and technical comfort level. For straightforward access with minimal setup, using a tunneling service like Ngrok or setting up a reverse SSH tunnel via a VPS are practical and commonly used solutions.
