# Stable Diffusion

## Hardware Configuration

To run deep learning models like Stable Diffusion, especially when seeking top performance, it is generally necessary to consider the following aspects of configuration, including GPU, memory, processor, and storage.

Here is a set of ideal hardware configuration recommendations without considering cost:

### GPU

- Model: NVIDIA RTX A6000 or higher models such as RTX 3090 Ti, RTX 4080, RTX 4090, or NVIDIA's professional GPUs like the Quadro series.
- Quantity: Multi-card setup, at least 4 cards, up to 8 cards or more depending on specific requirements. Multiple GPUs can significantly improve the speed of training and inference.
- VRAM: At least 24GB of VRAM per GPU card, more is better, as models like Stable Diffusion consume a large amount of VRAM during inference and training processes.

### CPU

- Model: Top-end processors from the Intel Xeon or AMD EPYC series, at least 16 cores, 32 threads, high frequency.
- Quantity: Depending on motherboard support, could be a single CPU or dual CPU setup.

### Memory

- Capacity: At least 128GB DDR4 ECC memory, recommended 256GB or higher. High-frequency memory can improve data processing speed.

### Storage

- System disk: 1TB NVMe SSD for installing the operating system and software.
- Data disk: High-speed NVMe SSD array or PCIe 4.0/5.0 SSD, total capacity of over 4TB, for storing training datasets, model parameters, etc. Higher read/write speeds help shorten data loading times.

### Motherboard

- Supports the aforementioned CPU and multi-GPU setups, with enough PCIe slots and high-speed I/O interfaces.

### Cooling System

- Powerful water cooling or air cooling system to ensure stability and performance during long periods of high-load tasks.

### Power Supply

- High efficiency (at least 80 PLUS Platinum certified) power supply, with a minimum power of 1600W, to support the power demands of multiple GPUs and other high-performance hardware.

### Software and Framework

- Operating System: Ubuntu Linux or another Linux distribution that supports CUDA and deep learning frameworks.

Deep learning frameworks: The latest version of PyTorch or TensorFlow, compatible with CUDA and cuDNN.

Please note that these configuration requirements are very high-end, mainly applicable to research and large-scale production environments. For individual users or small teams, depending on specific needs, more moderate configurations can be selected to balance performance and cost. Moreover, hardware technology is continuously advancing, and new generations of products may offer better performance. It is recommended to check the latest market conditions and product reviews before purchasing hardware.

### Cost Estimate

#### Deluxe Configuration

For the top-tier configuration mentioned above, the cost would be quite high, depending on market prices, purchase location, and timing. Here is a rough estimate:

| Component | Model | Quantity | Price |
| :---: | --- | :---: | --- |
| GPU | e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090, each around $1500-$2000 | Assuming 4 cards | Cost around $6000-$8000 |
| CPU | e.g., high-end Intel Xeon or AMD EPYC | 1 | $10000 |
| Memory | 256GB DDR4 ECC | 2 | Assuming each 128GB costs around $1000, total $2000 |
| Storage | 4TB high-speed NVMe SSD | 1 | Each TB costing around $500, total $2000 |
| Motherboard | e.g., ASUS Pro WS or Supermicro series | 1 | Price around $1000 |
| Other Configurations | Cooling system, power supply, and other accessories (case, network equipment, etc.) | 1 | Total around $800-$2000 |
| Total | | | $25800 |

Overall, the estimated cost for the top-tier configuration is about $25800 USD. This figure is a rough estimate, and actual costs may vary based on specific configuration choices, retailers, geographic location, and market supply and demand conditions. Additionally, the rapid development of technology and price fluctuations are also factors to consider when purchasing.

#### Ultra-Deluxe Configuration

In the case of not considering cost and only pursuing optimal performance, using NVIDIA RTX A6000 or newer, higher-end models like the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU, indeed can achieve more powerful performance. H100 is NVIDIA's GPU based on the Hopper architecture, designed for AI and high-performance computing, offering higher memory capacity and stronger computing power compared to the RTX 4090, especially in processing deep learning and complex scientific computing tasks. RTX A6000, aimed at professional workstations, is also very suitable for deep learning tasks.

Both Intel Xeon series and AMD EPYC series are high-performance server-grade CPUs, each with its advantages. Intel Xeon generally has stronger single-thread performance, while AMD EPYC has advantages in multi-core performance and cost-effectiveness. For high parallel computing tasks like deep learning, AMD EPYC might be a more suitable choice, especially as it supports more PCIe lanes, beneficial for connecting more GPUs.

Reconfiguring based on NVIDIA H100 GPU and AMD EPYC processor:

| Component | Model | Quantity | Price |
| :---: | --- | :---: | --- |
| GPU | NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU | 4 | $100000. Assuming each GPU costs $25000 (this is an estimate, actual prices may vary) |
| CPU | AMD EPYC 7763 64-core processor | 1 | About $8000 |
| Memory | 512GB (calculated with 128GB modules, total 4 modules) | 4 | About $4000 |
| Storage | 4TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD | 4 | About $8000 (total) |
| Motherboard | High-end motherboard compatible with AMD EPYC | 1 | About $1500 |
| Other Configurations | Cooling system, power supply, etc. | 1 | About $2000 |
| Total | $100000 + $8000 + $4000 + $8000 + $1500 + $2000 | | $124500 |

This estimate shows the cost of a configuration with the highest-end hardware on the market. It's important to note that these prices are only rough estimates, and actual purchasing prices may differ. Additionally, the market availability of high-end hardware may affect the actual purchase cost.
